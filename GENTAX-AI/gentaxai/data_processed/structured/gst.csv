FOREWORD The compilation of frequently asked questions on GST brought out by the apex training institute under the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) the National Academy of Customs, Excise & Narcotics (NACEN), has been extremely well received. These GST FAQs were released on 21st September, 2016 by the Hon’ble Finance Minister and were based on the Model GST Law as on June, 2016. The GST FAQs were translated in many regional languages to ensure dissemination across the country. A number of significant developments have taken place since the first edition was released. As of now the draft laws of CGST, SGST, IGST, UTGST and Compensation cess along with a host of rules have been approved by GST Council. The Central bills have been introduced in the Parliament; legislation relating to States will be passed by the respective state assemblies. As promised at the time of bringing the first edition, a second edition of the FAQs has been prepared by NACEN based on the aforesaid bills introduced in the Parliament. I congratulate DG, NACEN and his team for the efforts made and am sure that these will go a long way in disseminating knowledge and awareness on GST amongst the Tax officials, Trade and Public. Najib Shah Chairman, CBEC

Comments and Suggestions on FAQ may please be sent to dg.nacen-cbec@nic.in Disclaimer: This FAQ on GST compiled by NACEN and vetted by the Source Trainers is based on the CGST/SGST/UTGST/IGST Act(s). This FAQ is for training and academic purposes only. The information in this booklet is intended only to provide a general overview and is not intended to be treated as legal ad vice or opinion. For greater details, you are requested to refer to the respective CGST/SGST/UTGST/IGST Acts. The FAQs refer to CGST and SGST Acts as CGST/SGST as CGST Act and SGST Act are identical in most of the provisions. CGST Act has been introduced in the Parliament. The SGST Acts will be passed by respective state legislatures. A few provisions may be specific to state and may not be in CGST Act.
1. Overview of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Q 1. What is Goods and Services Tax (GST)? Ans. It is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as setoff. In a nutshell, only value addition will be taxed and burden of tax is to be borne by the final consumer. Q 2. What exactly is the concept of destination based tax on consumption? Ans. The tax would accrue to the taxing authority which has jurisdiction over the place of consumption which is also termed as place of supply. Q 3. Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be subsumed under GST? Ans. The GST would replace the following taxes: (i) taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre: a. Central Excise duty b. Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations) c. Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) d. Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products) e. Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD)
f. Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD) g. Service Tax h. Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services (ii) State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST are: a. State VAT b. Central Sales Tax c. Luxury Tax d. Entry Tax (all forms) e. Entertainment and Amusement Tax (except when levied by the local bodies) f. Taxes on advertisements g. Purchase Tax h. Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling i. State Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services The GST Council shall make recommendations to the Union and States on the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States and the local bodies which may be subsumed in the GST. Q 4. What principles were adopted for subsuming the above taxes under GST? Ans. The various Central, State and Local levies were examined to identify their possibility of being subsumed under GST. While identifying, the following principles were kept in mind: (i) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be primarily in the nature of indirect taxes, either on the supply of goods or on the supply of services.
(ii) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be part of the transaction chain which commences with import/ manufacture/ production of goods or provision of services at one end and the consumption of goods and services at the other. (iii) The subsumation should result in free flow of tax credit in intra and inter-State levels. The taxes, levies and fees that are not specifically related to supply of goods & services should not be subsumed under GST. (v) Revenue fairness for both the Union and the States individually would need to be attempted. Q 5. Which are the commodities proposed to be kept outside the purview of GST? Ans. Article 366(12A) of the Constitution as amended by 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016 defines the Goods and Services tax (GST) as a tax on supply of goods or services or both, except supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption. So alcohol for human consumption is kept out of GST by way of definition of GST in constitution. Five petroleum products viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel have temporarily been kept out and GST Council shall decide the date from which they shall be included in GST. Furthermore, electricity has been kept out of GST. Q 6. What will be the status in respect of taxation of above commodities after introduction of GST? Ans. The existing taxation system (VAT & Central Excise) will continue in respect of the above commodities. Q 7. What will be status of Tobacco and Tobacco
products under the GST regime? Ans. Tobacco and tobacco products would be subject to GST. In addition, the Centre would have the power to levy Central Excise duty on these products. Q 8. What type of GST is proposed to be implemented? Ans. It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying it on a common tax base. The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods and / or services would be called the Central GST (CGST) and that to be levied by the States/ Union territory would be called the State GST (SGST)/ UTGST. Similarly, Integrated GST (IGST) will be levied and administered by Centre on every inter-state supply of goods and services. Q 9. Why is Dual GST required? Ans. India is a federal country where both the Centre and the States have been assigned the powers to levy and collect taxes through appropriate legislation. Both the levels of Government have distinct responsibilities to perform according to the division of powers prescribed in the Constitution for which they need to raise resources. A dual GST will, therefore, be in keeping with the Constitutional requirement of fiscal federalism. Q 10. Which authority will levy and administer GST? Ans. Centre will levy and administer CGST & IGST while respective states /UTs will levy and administer SGST/ UTGST. Q 11. Why was the Constitution of India amended recently in the context of GST?
Currently, the fiscal powers between the Centre and the States are clearly demarcated in the Constitution with almost no overlap between the respective domains. The Centre has the powers to levy tax on the manufacture of goods (except alcoholic liquor for human consumption, opium, narcotics etc.) while the States have the powers to levy tax on the sale of goods. In the case of inter-State sales, the Centre has the power to levy a tax (the Central Sales Tax) but, the tax is collected and retained entirely by the States. As for services, it is the Centre alone that is empowered to levy service tax. Introduction of the GST required amendments in the Constitution so as to simultaneously empower the Centre and the States to levy and collect this tax. The Constitution of India has been amended by the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 for this purpose. Article 246A of the Constitution empowers the Centre and the States to levy and collect the GST. Q 12. How a particular transaction of goods and services would be taxed simultaneously under Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST)? Ans. The Central GST and the State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except the exempted goods and services, goods which are outside the purview of GST and the transactions which are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further, both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of CENVAT. While the location of the supplier and the recipient within the country is immaterial for the purpose of CGST, SGST would be chargeable only when the supplier and the recipient are both located within the State.
Illustration I: Suppose hypothetically that the rate of CGST is 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When a wholesale dealer of steel in Uttar Pradesh supplies steel bars and rods to a construction company which is also located within the same State for, say Rs. 100, the dealer would charge CGST of Rs. 10 and SGST of Rs. 10 in addition to the basic price of the goods. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central Government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not actually pay Rs. 20 (Rs. 10 + Rs. 10) in cash as he would be entitled to set- off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchases (say, inputs). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on his purchases while for SGST he can utilize the credit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST. Illustration II: Suppose, again hypothetically, that the rate of CGST is 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When an advertising company located in Mumbai supplies advertising services to a company manufacturing soap also located within the State of Maharashtra for, let us say Rs. 100, the ad company would charge CGST of Rs. 10 as well as SGST of Rs. 10 to the basic value of the service. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central Government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not again actually pay Rs. 20 (Rs. 10+Rs. 10) in cash as it would be entitled to set-off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchase (say, of inputs such as stationery, office equipment, services of an artist etc.). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST
paid on its purchase while for SGST he can utilise the credit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST. Q 13. What are the benefits which the Country will accrue from GST? Ans. Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market. For the consumers, the biggest gain would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%. Introduction of GST would also make our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. There may also be revenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening of the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved tax compliance. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent character, would be easier to administer. Q 14. What is IGST? Ans. Under the GST regime, an Integrated GST (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services. Under Article 269A of the Constitution, the GST on supplies in the course of inter- State trade or commerce shall be levied and collected by the Government of India and such tax shall be apportioned between the Union and the States in the manner as may be provided by Parliament by law on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax Council. Q 15. Who will decide rates for levy of GST?
Ans. The CGST and SGST would be levied at rates to be jointly decided by the Centre and States. The rates would be notified on the recommendations of the GST Council. Q 15. What would be the role of GST Council? Ans. A GST Council would be constituted comprising the Union Finance Minister (who will be the Chairman of the Council), the Minister of State (Revenue) and the State Finance/Taxation Ministers to make recommendations to the Union and the States on (i) the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States and the local bodies which may be subsumed under GST; (ii) the goods and services that may be subjected to or exempted from the GST; (iii) the date on which the GST shall be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor sprit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel; (iv) model GST laws, principles of levy, apportionment of IGST and the principles that govern the place of supply; (v) the threshold limit of turnover below which the goods and services may be exempted from GST; (vi) the rates including floor rates with bands of GST; (vii) any special rate or rates for a specified period to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster; (viii) special provision with respect to the North- East States, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand; and
(ix) any other matter relating to the GST, as the Council may decide. Q 16. What is the guiding principle of GST Council? Ans. The mechanism of GST Council would ensure harmonization on different aspects of GST between the Centre and the States as well as among States. It has been provided in the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 that the GST Council, in its discharge of various functions, shall be guided by the need for a harmonized structure of GST and for the development of a harmonized national market for goods and services. Q 17. How will decisions be taken by GST Council? Ans. The Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 provides that every decision of the GST Council shall be taken at a meeting by a majority of not less than 3/4th of the weighted votes of the Members present and voting. The vote of the Central Government shall have a weightage of 1/3rd of the votes cast and the votes of all the State Governments taken together shall have a weightage of 2/3rd of the total votes cast in that meeting. One half of the total number of members of the GST Council shall constitute the quorum at its meetings. Q 18. Who is liable to pay GST under the proposed GST regime? Ans. Under the GST regime, tax is payable by the taxable person on the supply of goods and/or services. Liability to pay tax arises when the taxable person crosses the turnover threshold of Rs.20 lakhs (Rs. 10 lakhs for NE & Special Category States) except in certain specified cases where the taxable person is liable to pay GST even though he has not
crossed the threshold limit. The CGST / SGST is payable on all intra-State supply of goods and/or services and IGST is payable on all inter- State supply of goods and/or services. The CGST /SGST and IGST are payable at the rates specified in the Schedules to the respective Acts. Q 19. What are the benefits available to small tax payers under the GST regime? Ans. Tax payers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year up to [Rs.20 lakhs & Rs.10 Lakhs for NE and special category states] would be exempt from tax. Further, a person whose aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is less than Rs.50 Lakhs can opt for a simplified composition scheme where tax will payable at a concessional rate on the turnover in a state. [Aggregate turnover shall include the aggregate value of all taxable supplies, exempt supplies and exports of goods and/or services and exclude taxes viz. GST.] Aggregate turnover shall be computed on all India basis. For NE States and special category states, the exemption threshold shall be [Rs. 10 lakhs]. All taxpayers eligible for threshold exemption will have the option of paying tax with input tax credit (ITC) benefits. Tax payers making inter-State supplies or paying tax on reverse charge basis shall not be eligible for threshold exemption. Q 20. How will the goods and services be classified under GST regime? Ans. HSN (Harmonised System of Nomenclature) code shall be used for classifying the goods under the GST regime. Taxpayers whose turnover is above Rs. 1.5 crores but below Rs. 5 crores shall use 2-digit code and the taxpayers whose turnover is Rs. 5 crores and above shall use 4-digit code. Taxpayers whose turnover is below Rs. 1.5 crores are not
required to mention HSN Code in their invoices. Services will be classified as per the Services Accounting Code (SAC) Q 21. How will imports be taxed under GST? Ans. Imports of Goods and Services will be treated as inter-state supplies and IGST will be levied on import of goods and services into the country. The incidence of tax will follow the destination principle and the tax revenue in case of SGST will accrue to the State where the imported goods and services are consumed. Full and complete set-off will be available on the GST paid on import on goods and services. Q 22. How will Exports be treated under GST? Ans. Exports will be treated as zero rated supplies. No tax will be payable on exports of goods or services, however credit of input tax credit will be available and same will be available as refund to the exporters. The Exporter will have an option to either pay tax on the output and claim refund of IGST or export under Bond without payment of IGST and claim refund of Input Tax Credit (ITC). Q 23. What is the scope of composition scheme under GST? Ans. Small taxpayers with an aggregate turnover in a preceding financial year up to [Rs. 50 lakhs] shall be eligible for composition levy. Under the scheme, a taxpayer shall pay tax as a percentage of his turnover in a state during the year without the benefit of ITC. The rate of tax for CGST and SGST/UTGST shall not be less than [1% for manufacturer & 0.5% in other cases; 2.5% for specific services as mentioned in para 6(b) of Schedule II viz Serving of food or any other article for human
consumption]. A tax payer opting for composition levy shall not collect any tax from his customers. The government may increase the above said limit of 50 lakhs rupees to up to one crore rupees, on the recommendation of GST Council. Tax payers making inter- state supplies or making supplies through ecommerce operators who are required to collect tax at source shall not be eligible for composition scheme. Q 24. Whether the composition scheme will be optional or compulsory? Ans. Optional. Q 25. What is GSTN and its role in the GST regime? Ans. GSTN stands for Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN). A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST. The functions of the GSTN would, inter alia, include: (i) facilitating registration; (ii) forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities; (iii) computation and settlement of IGST; (iv) matching of tax payment details with banking network; (v) providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the tax payer return information; (vi) providing analysis of tax payers’ profile; and (vii) running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit. The GSTN is developing a common GST portal and applications for registration, payment, return and MIS/ reports. The GSTN would also be integrating the common GST portal with the existing tax administration IT systems
and would be building interfaces for tax payers. Further, the GSTN is developing back-end modules like assessment, audit, refund, appeal etc. for 19 States and UTs (Model II States). The CBEC and Model I States (15 States) are themselves developing their GST back-end systems. Integration of GST front-end system with back-end systems will have to be completed and tested well in advance for making the transition smooth. Q 26. How are the disputes going to be resolved under the GST regime? Ans. The Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 provides that the Goods and Services Tax Council shall establish a mechanism to adjudicate any dispute- (a) between the Government of India and one or more States; or (b) between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other Sates on the other side; or (c) between two or more States, arising out of the recommendations of the Council or implementation thereof. Q 27. What is the purpose of Compliance rating mechanism? Ans. As per Section 149 of the CGST/SGST Act, every registered person shall be assigned a compliance rating based on the record of compliance in respect of specified parameters. Such ratings shall also be placed in the public domain. A prospective client will be able to see the compliance ratings of suppliers and take a decision as to
whether to deal with a particular supplier or not. This will create healthy competition amongst taxable persons. Q 28. Whether actionable claims liable to GST? Ans. As per section 2(52) of the CGST/SGST Act actionable claims are to be considered as goods. Schedule III read with Section 7 of the CGST/SGST Act lists the activities or transactions which shall be treated neither as supply of goods nor supply of services. The Schedule lists actionable claims other than lottery, betting and gambling as one of such transactions. Thus only lottery, betting and gambling shall be treated as supplies under the GST regime. All the other actionable claims shall not be supplies. Q 29. Whether transaction in securities be taxable in GST? Ans. Securities have been specifically excluded from the definition of goods as well as services. Thus, the transaction in securities shall not be liable to GST. Q 30. What is the concept of Information Return? Ans. Information return is based on the idea of verifying the compliance levels of registered persons through information procured from independent third party sources. As per section 150 of the CGST/SGST Act, many authorities who are responsible for maintaining records of registration or statement of accounts or any periodic return or document containing details of payment of tax and other details of transaction of goods or services or both or transactions related to a bank account or consumption of electricity or transaction of purchase, sale or exchange of
goods or property or right or interest in a property under any law for the time being in force, are mandated to furnish an information return of the same in respect of such periods, within such time, in such form and manner and to such authority or agency as may be prescribed. Failure to do so may result in penalty being imposed as per Section 123. Q 31. Different companies have different types of accounting software packages and no specific format are mandated for keeping records. How will department be able to read into these complex software? Ans. As per Section 153 of the CGST/SGST Act, having regard to the nature and complexity of a case and in the interest of revenue, department may take assistance from an expert at any state of scrutiny, inquiry, investigation or any other proceedings. Q 32. Is there any provision in GST for tax treatment of goods returned by the recipient? Ans. Yes, Section 34 deals with such situations. Where the goods supplied are returned by the recipient, the registered person (supplier of goods) may issue to the recipient a credit note containing the prescribed particulars. The details of the credit note shall be declared by the supplier in the returns for the month during which such credit note was issued but not later than September following the end of the year in which such supply was made or the date of filing of the relevant annual return, whichever is earlier. The details of the credit note shall be matched with the corresponding reduction in claim for input tax credit by the recipient in his valid return for the same tax period or any subsequent tax period and the claim for reduction in
output tax liability by the supplier that matches with the corresponding reduction in claim for ITC by the recipient shall be finally accepted and communicated to both parties. Q 33. What is Anti-Profiteering measure? Ans. As per section 171 of the CGST/SGST Act, any reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices. An authority may be constituted by the government to examine whether input tax credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or services or both supplied by him. ****
2. Levy of and Exemption from Tax Q 1. Where is the power to levy GST derived from? Ans. Article 246A of the Constitution, which was introduced by the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 confers concurrent powers to both, Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws with respect to GST i. e. central tax (CGST) and state tax (SGST) or union territory tax (UTGST). However, clause 2 of Article 246A read with Article 269A provides exclusive power to the Parliament to legislate with respect to inter-State trade or commerce i.e. integrated tax (IGST). Q 2. What is the taxable event under GST? Ans. Taxable event under GST is supply of goods or services or both. CGST and SGST/ UTGST will be levied on intra-State supplies. IGST will be levied on inter-State supplies. Q 3. Whether supplies made without consideration will also come within the purview of supply under GST? Ans. Yes, but only those activities which are specified in Schedule I to the CGST Act / SGST Act. The said provision has been adopted in IGST Act as well as in UTGST Act also. Q 4. Will giving away essential commodities by a charitable institution be taxable activity? Ans. In order to be a supply which is taxable under GST, the transaction should be in the course or furtherance of
business. As there is no quid pro quo involved in supply for charitable activities, it is not a supply under GST. Q 5. Who can notify a transaction to be supply of goods or services? Ans. Central Government or State Government, on the recommendations of the GST Council, can notify an activity to be the supply of goods and not supply of services or supply of services and not supply of goods or neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. Q 6. What are composite supply and mixed supply? How are these two different from each other? Ans. Composite supply is a supply consisting of two or more taxable supplies of goods or services or both or any combination thereof, which are bundled in natural course and are supplied in conjunction with each other in the ordinary course of business and where one of which is a principal supply. For example, when a consumer buys a television set and he also gets warranty and a maintenance contract with the TV, this supply is a composite supply. In this example, supply of TV is the principal supply, warranty and maintenance service are ancillary. Mixed supply is combination of more than one individual supplies of goods or services or any combination thereof made in conjunction with each other for a single price, which can ordinarily be supplied separately. For example, a shopkeeper selling storage water bottles along with refrigerator. Bottles and the refrigerator can easily be priced and sold separately.
Q 7. What is the treatment of composite supply and mixed supply under GST? Ans. Composite supply shall be treated as supply of the principal supply. Mixed supply would be treated as supply of that particular goods or services which attracts the highest rate of tax. Q 8. Are all goods and services taxable under GST? Ans. Supplies of all goods and services are taxable except alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Supply of petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel shall be taxable with effect from a future date. This date would be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the GST Council. Q 9. What is meant by Reverse Charge? Ans. It means the liability to pay tax is on the recipient of supply of goods and services instead of the supplier of such goods or services in respect of notified categories of supply. Q 10. Is the reverse charge mechanism applicable only to services? Ans. No, reverse charge applies to supplies of both goods and services, as notified by the Government on the recommendations of the GST Council. Q 11. What will be the implications in case of
receipt of supply from unregistered persons? Ans. In case of receipt of supply from an unregistered person, the registered person who is receiving goods or services shall be liable to pay tax under reverse charge mechanism. Q 12. Can any person other than the supplier or recipient be liable to pay tax under GST? Ans. Yes, the Central/State government can specify categories of services the tax on which shall be paid by the electronic commerce operator, if such services are supplied through it and all the provisions of the Act shall apply to such electronic commerce operator as if he is the person liable to pay tax in relation to supply of such services. Q 13. What is the threshold for opting to pay tax under the composition scheme? Ans. The threshold for composition scheme is Rs. 50 Lakhs of aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year. The benefit of composition scheme can be availed up to the turnover of Rs. 50 Lakhs in current financial year. Q 14. What are the rates of tax for composition scheme? Ans. There are different rates for different sectors. In normal cases of supplier of goods (i.e. traders), the composition rate is 0.5 % of the turnover in a State or Union territory. If the person opting for composition scheme is manufacturer, then the rate is 1% of the turnover in a State or Union territory. In case of restaurant services, it is 2.5% of the turnover in a State or Union territory. These rates are under one Act, and same rate would be applicable in the other Act also. So, effectively, the composition rates (combined rate under CGST and SGST/UTGST) are 1%, 2% and 5% for normal
supplier, manufacturer and restaurant service respectively. Q 15. A person availing composition scheme during a financial year crosses the turnover of Rs.50 Lakhs during the course of the year i.e. say he crosses the turnover of Rs.50 Lakhs in December? Will he be allowed to pay tax under composition scheme for the remainder of the year i.e. till 31st March? Ans. No. The option availed shall lapse from the day on which his aggregate turnover during the financial year exceeds Rs.50 Lakhs. Q 16. Will a taxable person, having multiple registrations, be eligible to opt for composition scheme only for a few of registrations? Ans. All registered persons having the same Permanent Account Number (PAN) have to opt for composition scheme. If one registered person opts for normal scheme, others become ineligible for composition scheme. Q 17. Can composition scheme be availed of by a manufacturer and a service supplier? Ans. Yes, a manufacturer can opt for composition scheme generally. However, a manufacturer of goods, which would be notified on the recommendations of the GST Council, cannot opt for this scheme. This scheme is not available for services sector, except restaurants. Q 18. Who are not eligible to opt for composition scheme? Ans.

However, in specified cases like imports and other notified supplies, the liability may be cast on the recipient under the reverse charge mechanism. Further, in some notified cases of intra-state supply of services, the liability to pay GST may be cast on e-commerce operators through which such services are supplied. Also Government Departments making payments to vendors above a specified limit [2.5 lakh under one contract as per S.51(1)(d)] are required to deduct tax (TDS) and E-commerce operators are required to collect tax (TCS) on the net value [i.e. aggregate value of taxable supplies of goods and/or services but excluding such value of services on which the operator is made liable to pay GST under Section 9(5) of the CGST Act, 2017] of supplies made through them and deposit it with the Government.

Q 5. How can payment be done? Ans. Payment can be done by the following methods: (i) Through debit of Credit Ledger of the tax payer maintained on the Common Portal – ONLY Tax can be paid. Interest, Penalty and Fees cannot be paid by debit in the credit ledger. Tax payers shall be allowed to take credit of taxes paid on inputs (input tax credit) and utilize the same for payment of output tax. However, no input tax credit on account of CGST shall be utilized towards payment of SGST and vice versa. The credit of IGST would be permitted to be utilized for payment of IGST, CGST and SGST in that order. (ii) In cash by debit in the Cash Ledger of the tax payer maintained on the Common Portal. Money can be deposited in the Cash Ledger by different modes, namely, E-Payment (Internet Banking, Credit Card, Debit Card); Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)/ National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT); Over the Counter Payment in branches of Banks Authorized to accept deposit of GST. Q 6. When is payment of taxes to be made by the Supplier? Ans. Payment of taxes by the normal tax payer is to be done on monthly basis by the 20th of the succeeding month. Cash payments will be first deposited in the Cash Ledger and the tax payer shall debit the ledger while making payment in the monthly returns and shall reflect the relevant debit entry number in his return. As mentioned earlier, payment can also be debited from the Credit Ledger. Payment of taxes for the month of March shall be paid by the 20th of April. Composition tax payers will need to pay tax on
quarterly basis. Q 7. Whether time limit for payment of tax can be extended or paid in monthly installments? Ans. No, this is not permitted in case of self-assessed liability. In other cases, competent authority has been empowered to extend the time period or allow payment in instalments. (Section 80 of the CGST/SGST Act). Q 8. What happens if the taxable person files the return but does not make payment of tax? Ans. In such cases, the return is not considered as a valid return. Section 2(117) defines a valid return to mean a return furnished under sub-section (1) of section 39 on which self-assessed tax has been paid in full. It is only the valid return that would be used for allowing input tax credit (ITC) to the recipient. In other words, unless the supplier has paid the entire self-assessed tax and filed his return and the recipient has filed his return, the ITC of the recipient would not be confirmed. Q 9. Which date is considered as date of deposit of the tax dues – Date of presentation of cheque or Date of payment or Date of credit of amount in the account of government? Ans. It is the date of credit to the Government account.
Q 10. What are E-Ledgers? Ans. Electronic Ledgers or E-Ledgers are statements of cash and input tax credit in respect of each registered taxpayer. In addition, each taxpayer shall also have an electronic tax liability register. Once a taxpayer is registered on Common Portal (GSTN), two e-ledgers (Cash &Input Tax Credit ledger) and an electronic tax liability register will be automatically opened and displayed on his dash board at all times. Q 11. What is a tax liability register? Ans. Tax Liability Register will reflect the total tax liability of a taxpayer (after netting) for the particular month. Q 12. What is a Cash Ledger? Ans. The cash ledger will reflect all deposits made in cash, and TDS/TCS made on account of the taxpayer. The information will be reflected on real time basis. This ledger can be used for making any payment on account of GST. Q 13. What is an ITC Ledger? Ans. Input Tax Credit as self-assessed in monthly returns will be reflected in the ITC Ledger. The credit in this ledger can be used to make payment of TAX ONLY and not other amounts such as interest, penalty, fees etc. Q 14. What is the linkage between GSTN and the authorized Banks?
Ans. There will be real time two-way linkage between the GSTN and the Core Banking Solution (CBS) of the Bank. CPIN is automatically routed to the Bank via electronic string for verification and receiving payment and a challan identification number (CIN) is automatically sent by the Bank to the Common Portal confirming payment receipt. No manual intervention will be involved in the process by any one including bank cashier or teller or the tax payer. Q 15. Can a tax payer generate challan in multiple sittings? Ans. Yes, a taxpayer can partially fill in the challan form and temporarily “save” the challan for completion at a later stage. A saved challan can be “edited” before finalization. After the tax payer has finalized the challan, he will generate the challan, for use of payment of taxes. The remitter will have option of printing the challan for his record. Q 16. Can a challan generated online be modified? Ans. No. After logging into GSTN portal for generation of challan, payment particulars have to be fed in by the tax payer or his authorized person. He can save the challan midway for future updation. However once the challan is finalized and CPIN generated, no further changes can be made to it by the taxpayer.
Q 17. Is there a validity period of challan? Ans. Yes, a challan will be valid for fifteen days after its generation and thereafter it will be purged from the System. However, the tax payer can generate another challan at his convenience. Q 18. What is a CPIN? Ans. CPIN stands for Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN) given at the time of generation of challan. It is a 14-digit unique number to identify the challan. As stated above, the CPIN remains valid for a period of 15 days. Q 19. What is a CIN and what is its relevance? Ans. CIN stands for Challan Identification Number. It is a 17-digit number that is 14-digit CPIN plus 3-digit Bank Code. CIN is generated by the authorized banks/ Reserve Bank of India (RBI) when payment is actually received by such authorized banks or RBI and credited in the relevant government account held with them. It is an indication that the payment has been realized and credited to the appropriate government account. CIN is communicated by the authorized bank to taxpayer as well as to GSTN. Q 20. What is the sequence of payment of tax where that taxpayer has liabilities for previous months also? Ans. Section 49(8) prescribes an order of payment where the taxpayer has tax liability beyond the current return period. In such a situation, the order of payment to be followed is: First self-assessed tax and other dues for the previous period; thereafter self-assessed tax and other
dues for the current period; and thereafter any other amounts payable including any confirmed demands under section 73 or 74. This sequence has to be mandatorily followed. Q 21. What does the expression “Other dues” referred to above mean? Ans. The expression “other dues” means interest, penalty, fee or any other amount payable under the Act or the rules made thereunder. Q 22. What is an E-FPB? Ans. E-FPB stands for Electronic Focal Point Branch. These are branches of authorized banks which are authorized to collect payment of GST. Each authorized bank will nominate only one branch as its E-FPB for pan India Transactions. The E-FPB will have to open accounts under each major head for all governments. Total 38 accounts (one each for CGST, IGST and one each for SGST for each State/UT Govt.) will have to be opened. Any amount received by such E-FPB towards GST will be credited to the appropriate account held by such E- FPB. For NEFT/RTGS Transactions, RBI will act as E-FPB. Q 23. What is TDS? Ans. TDS stands for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). As per section 51, this provision is meant for Government and Government undertakings and other notified entities making contractual payments where total value of such supply under a contract exceeds Rs. 2.5 Lakhs to suppliers. While making any
payments under such contracts, the concerned Government/authority shall deduct 1% of the total payment made and remit it into the appropriate GST account. Q 24. How will the Supplier account for this TDS? while filing his return? Ans. Any amount shown as TDS will be reflected in the electronic cash ledger of the concerned supplier. He can utilize this amount towards discharging his liability towards tax, interest fees and any other amount. Q 25. How will the TDS Deductor account for such TDS? Ans. TDS Deductor will account for such TDS in the following ways: 1. Such deductors needs to get compulsorily registered under section 24 of the CGST/SGST Act. 2. They need to remit such TDS collected by the 10th day of the month succeeding the month in which TDS was collected and reported in GSTR 7. 3. The amount deposited as TDS will be reflected in the electronic cash ledger of the supplier. 4. They need to issue certificate of such TDS to the deductee within 5 days of crediting the TDS to the govt a/c, failing which fees of Rs. 100 per day subject to maximum of Rs. 5000/- will be payable by such deductor. Q 26. What is Tax Collected at Source (TCS)? Ans. This provision is applicable only for E-Commerce Operator under section 52 of CGST/SGST Act. Every E-
Commerce Operator, not being an agent, needs to withhold an amount calculated at the rate not exceeding one percent of the “net value of taxable supplies” made through it where the consideration with respect to such supplies is to be collected by the operator. Such withheld amount is to be deposited by such E-Commerce Operator to the appropriate GST account by the 10th of the next month. The amount deposited as TCS will be reflected in the electronic cash ledger of the supplier. Q 27. What does the expression “Net value of taxable supplies” mean? Ans. The expression “net value of taxable supplies” means the aggregate value of taxable supplies of goods or services, other than services notified under Section 9(5), made during any month by all registered taxable persons through the operator reduced by the aggregate value of taxable supplies returned to the suppliers during the said month. Q 28. Is the pre-registration of credit card necessary in the GSTN portal for the GST payment? Ans. Yes. The taxpayer would be required to pre-register his credit card, from which the tax payment is intended, with the Common Portal maintained on GSTN. GSTN may also attempt to put in a system with banks in getting the credit card verified by taking a confirmation from the credit card service provider. The payments using credit cards can therefore be allowed without any monetary limit to facilitate ease of doing business. ****

9. Job Work Q 1. What is job work? Ans. Job work means undertaking any treatment or process by a person on goods belonging to another registered taxable person. The person who is treating or processing the goods belonging to other person is called ‘job worker’ and the person to whom the goods belongs is called ‘principal’. This definition is much wider than the one given in Notification No. 214/86 – CE dated 23rd March, 1986. In the said notification, job work has been defined in such a manner so as to ensure that the activity of job work must amount to manufacture. Thus the definition of job work itself reflects the change in basic scheme of taxation relating to job work in the proposed GST regime. Q 2. Whether goods sent by a taxable person to a job worker will be treated as supply and liable to GST? Why? Ans. It will be treated as a supply as supply includes all forms of supply such as sale, transfer, etc. However, the registered taxable person (the principal), under intimation and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed send any inputs and/or capital goods, without payment of tax, to a job worker for job work and from there subsequently to another job worker(s) and shall either bring back such inputs/capital goods after completion of job work or otherwise within 1 year/3years of their being sent out or supply such inputs/capital goods after completion of job work or otherwise within 1 year / 3 years of their being sent out, from the place of business of a job worker on payment of tax within India or with or without payment of tax for export.
Q 3. Is a job worker required to take registration? Ans. Yes, as job work is a service, the job worker would be required to obtain registration if his aggregate turnover exceeds the prescribed threshold. Q 4. Whether the goods of principal directly supplied from the job worker’s premises will be included in the aggregate turnover of the job worker? Ans. No. It will be included in the aggregate turnover of the principal. However, the value of goods or services used by the job worker for carrying out the job work will be included in the value of services supplied by the job worker. Q 5. Can a principal send inputs and capital goods directly to the premises of job worker without bringing it to his premises? Ans. Yes, the principal is allowed to do so. The input tax credit of tax paid on inputs or capital goods can also be availed by the principal in such a scenario. The inputs or capital goods must be received back within one year or three years respectively failing which the original transaction would be treated as supply and the principal would be liable to pay tax accordingly. Q 6. Can the principal supply the goods directly from the premises of the job worker without bringing it back to his own premises? Ans. Yes. But the principal should have declared the premises of an unregistered job worker as his additional place of business. If the job worker is a registered person then goods can be supplied directly from the premises of the job worker. The Commissioner may also notify goods
in which case goods sent for job work can be directly supplied from the premises of the job worker. Q 7. Under what circumstances can the principal directly supply goods from the premises of job worker without declaring the premises of job worker as his additional place of business? Ans. The goods can be supplied directly from the place of business of job worker without declaring it as additional place of business in two circumstances namely where the job worker is a registered taxable person or where the principal is engaged in supply of such goods as may be notified by the Commissioner. Q 8. What are the provisions concerning taking of ITC in respect of inputs/capital goods sent to a job worker? Ans. Principal shall be entitled to take credit of taxes paid on inputs or capital goods sent to a job worker whether sent after receiving them at his place of business or even when such the inputs or capital goods are directly sent to a job worker without their being first brought to his place of business. However, the inputs or capital goods, after completion of job work, are required to be received back or supplied from job worker’s premises, as the case may be, within a period of one year or three years of their being sent out. Q 9. What happens when the inputs or capital goods are not received back or supplied from the place of business of job worker within prescribed time period? Ans. If the inputs or capital goods are not received back by the principal or are not supplied from the place of business of job worker within the prescribed time limit, it
would be deemed that such inputs or capital goods had been supplied by the principal to the job worker on the day when the said inputs or capital goods were sent out by the principal (or on the date of receipt by the job worker where the inputs or capital goods were sent directly to the place of business of job worker). Thus the principal would be liable to pay tax accordingly. Q 10. Some capital goods like jigs and fixtures are non-usable after their use and normally sold as scrap. What is the treatment of such items in job work provisions? Ans. The condition of bringing back capital goods within three years is not applicable to moulds, dies, jigs and fixtures or tools. Q 11. What would be treatment of the waste and scrap generated during the job work? Ans. The waste and scrap generated during the job work can be supplied by the job worker directly from his place of business, on payment of tax, if he is registered. If he is not registered, the same would be supplied by the principal on payment of tax. Q 12. Whether intermediate goods can also be sent for job work? Ans. Yes. The term inputs, for the purpose of job work, includes intermediate goods arising from any treatment or process carried out on the inputs by the principal or job worker. Q 13. Who is responsible for the
maintenance of proper accounts related to job work? Ans. It is completely the responsibility of the principal to maintain proper accounts of job work related inputs and capital goods. Q 14. Are the provisions of job work applicable to all categories of goods? Ans. No. The provisions relating to job work are applicable only when registered taxable person intends to send taxable goods. In other words, these provisions are not applicable to exempted or non-taxable goods or when the sender is a person other than registered taxable person. Q 15. Is it compulsory that job work provisions should be followed by the principal? Ans. No. The principal can send the inputs or capital goods after payment of GST without following the special procedure. In such a case, the job-worker would take the input tax credit and supply back the processed goods (after completion of job-work) on payment of GST. Q 16. Should job worker and principal be located in same State or Union territory? Ans. No this is not necessary as provisions relating to job work have been adopted in the IGST Act as well as in UTGST Act and therefore job-worker and principal can be located either is same State or in same Union Territory or in different States or Union Territories.
10. Input Tax Credit Q 1. What is input tax? Ans. Input tax means the central tax (CGST), State tax (SGST), integrated tax (IGST) or Union territory tax (UTGST) charged on supply of goods or services or both made to a registered person. It also includes tax paid on reverse charge basis and integrated tax goods and services tax charged on import of goods. It does not include tax paid under composition levy. Q 2. Can GST paid on reverse charge basis be considered as input tax? Ans. Yes. The definition of input tax includes the tax payable under the reverse charge. Q 3. Does input tax includes tax (CGST/IGST/SGST) paid on input goods, input services and capital goods? Ans. Yes, it includes taxes paid on input goods, input services and capital goods. Credit of tax paid on capital goods is permitted to be availed in one instalment. Q 4. Is credit of all input tax charged on supply of goods or services allowed under GST? Ans. A registered person is entitled to take credit of input tax charged on supply of goods or services or both to him which are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business, subject to other conditions and restrictions. Q 5. What are the conditions necessary for
obtaining ITC? Ans. Following four conditions are to be satisfied by the registered taxable person for obtaining ITC: (a) he is in possession of tax invoice or debit note or such other tax paying documents as may be prescribed; (b) he has received the goods or services or both; (c) the supplier has actually paid the tax charged in respect of the supply to the government; and (d) he has furnished the return under section 39. Q 6. Where the goods against an invoice are received in lots or instalments, how will a registered person be entitled to ITC? Ans. The registered person shall be entitled to the credit only upon receipt of the last lot or installment. Q 7. Can a person take input tax credit without payment of consideration for the supply along with tax to the supplier? Ans. Yes, the recipient can take ITC. But he is required to pay the consideration along with tax within 180 days from the date of issue of invoice. This condition is not applicable where tax is payable on reverse charge basis. Q 8. What would happen of the ITC taken by the registered person if he has not paid the consideration along with tax within 180 days from the date of issue of invoice? Ans. The amount of ITC would be added to output tax liability of the person. He would also be required to pay interest.
However, he can take ITC again on payment of consideration and tax. Q 9. Who will get the ITC where goods have been delivered to a person other than taxable person (‘bill to’- ‘ship to ’scenarios)? Ans. It would be deemed that the registered person has received the goods when the goods have been delivered to a third party on the direction of such taxable person. So ITC will be available to the person on whose order the goods are delivered to third person. Q 10. What is the time limit for taking ITC and reasons therefor? Ans. A registered person cannot take ITC in respect of any invoice or debit note for supply of goods or services after the due date for furnishing the return under section 39 for the month of September following the end of financial year to which such invoice/invoice relating to debit note pertains or furnishing of the relevant annual return, whichever is earlier. So, the upper time limit for taking ITC is 20th October of the next FY or the date of filing of annual return whichever is earlier. The underlying reasoning for this restriction is that no change in return is permitted after September of next FY. If annual return is filed before the month of September, then no change can be made after filing of annual return. Q 11. Where the registered taxable person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital goods under the provisions of the Income Tax Act,1961, will ITC be allowed in such cases? Ans. The input tax credit shall not be allowed on the said
tax component in respect of which depreciation has been claimed. Q 12. Is credit of tax paid on every input used for supply of taxable goods or services or both is allowed under GST? Ans. Yes, except a small list of items provided in the law, the credit is admissible on all items. The list covers mainly items of personal consumption, inputs use of which results into formation of an immovable property (except plant and machinery), telecommunication towers, pipelines laid outside the factory premises, etc. and taxes paid as a result of detection of evasion of taxes. Q 13. A taxable person is in the business of information technology. He buys a motor vehicle for use of his Executive Directors. Can he avail the ITC in respect of GST paid on purchase of such motor vehicle? Ans. No. ITC on motor vehicles can be availed only if the taxable person is in the business of transport of passengers or goods or is providing the services of imparting training on motor vehicles. Q 14. Sometimes goods are destroyed or lost due to various reasons? Can a person take ITC to the extent of such goods? Ans. No, a person cannot take ITC with respect to goods lost, stolen, destroyed or written off. In addition, ITC with respect of goods given as gifts or free samples are also not allowed. Q 15. Can a registered person get ITC with respect of goods or services used for construction of a building for business purposes? Ans. No. ITC on goods or services by a person for
construction of immovable property, other than plant and machinery, is not allowed. Plant and machinery cover only apparatus, equipment, and machinery fixed to earth by foundation or structural support, and excludes land and building, among other things. Q 16. What is the ITC entitlement of a newly registered person? Ans. A person applying for registration can take input tax credit of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi- finished or finished goods held in stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant of registration. If the person was liable to take registration and he has applied for registration within thirty days from the date on which he became liable to registration, then input tax credit of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi- finished or finished goods held in stock on the day immediately preceding the date on which he became liable to pay tax can be taken. Q 17. A person becomes liable to pay tax on 1st August, 2017and has obtained registration on 15th August, 2017. Such person is eligible for input tax credit on inputs held in stock as on: (a) 1st August, 2017 (b) 31st July, 2017 (c) 15th August, 2017 (d) He cannot take credit for the past period Ans. 31st July, 2017. Q 18. What is the eligibility of input tax credit on inputs in stock for a person who obtains voluntary registration? Ans. The person who obtains voluntary registration is
entitled to take the input tax credit of input tax on inputs in stock, inputs in semi- finished goods and finished goods in stock, held on the day immediately preceding the date of registration. Q 19. What would be input tax eligibility in cases where there is a change in the constitution of a registered person? Ans. The registered person shall be allowed to transfer the input tax credit that remains unutilized in its electronic credit ledger to the new entity, provided that there is a specific provision for transfer of liabilities. Q 20. Where goods or services or both received by a taxable person are used for effecting both taxable and non-taxable supplies, whether the input tax credit is available to the registered taxable person? Ans. The input tax credit of goods or services or both attributable only to taxable supplies can be taken by registered person. The manner of calculation of eligible credit would be provided by rules. Q 21. If input tax credit is allowed only in respect of goods or services or both for effecting taxable supplies, would it not lead to loss of input tax credit on exempt supplies when exported? Ans. Zero-rated supplies have been covered within taxable supplies for the purpose of allowing input tax credit. The scope of zero-rated supply is provided in the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act which includes even exempt supplies.
Q 22. Which of the following is included for computation of taxable supplies for the purpose of availing credit? (a) Zero-rated supplies (b) Exempt supplies (c) Both Ans. Zero rated supplies. Q 23. Where goods or services received by a registered person are used partly for the purpose of business and partly for other purposes, whether the input tax credit is available to the person? Ans. The input tax credit of goods or services or both attributable only to the purpose of business can be taken by registered person. The manner of calculation of eligible credit would be provided by rules. Q 24. A person paying tax under compounding scheme crosses the compounding threshold and becomes a regular taxable person. Can he avail ITC and if so from what date? Ans. He can avail ITC in respect of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock and on capital goods (reduced by prescribed percentage points) on the day immediately preceding the date from which he ceases to be eligible for composition scheme. The manner of calculation of eligible credit would be provided by rules.
Q 25. Are there any special provisions in respect of banking companies? Ans. A banking company or a financial institution including a non-banking financial company engaged in supply of specified services would either avail proportionate credit or avail 50% of the eligible input tax credit. Q 26. Mr. A, a registered person was paying tax under composition scheme up to 30th July, 2017. However, w.e.f 31st July, 2017, Mr. A becomes liable to pay tax under regular scheme. Is he eligible for ITC? Ans. Mr. A is eligible for input tax credit on inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock and capital goods (reduced by such percentage points as may be prescribed) as on 30th July, 2017. Q 27. Mr. B applies for voluntary registration on 5th June, 2017 and obtained registration on 22nd June, 2017. Mr. B is eligible for input tax credit on inputs in stock as on………….. Ans. Mr. B is eligible for input tax credit on inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock as on 21st June, 2017. Mr. B cannot take input tax credit in respect of capital goods. Q 28. What would happen to the input tax credit availed by a registered person who opts for composition scheme or where the goods or services or both supplied by him become wholly exempt?
Ans. The registered person has to pay an amount equal to the input tax credit in respect of stocks held on the day immediately preceding the date of exercise of option or date of exemption. In respect of capital goods, the payable amount would be calculated by reducing by a prescribed percentage point. The payment can be made by debiting electronic credit ledger, if there is sufficient balance in the credit ledger, or by debiting electronic cash ledger. If any balance remains in the credit ledger, it would lapse. Q 29. Is there any restriction on period for availment of ITC? Ans. In cases of new registration, change from composition to normal scheme, from exempt to taxable supplies, the concerned person cannot avail ITC after the expiry of one year from the date of issue of tax invoice relating to such supply. Q 30. What happens where the details of inward supplies furnished by the recipient do not match with the outward supply details furnished by the supplier in his valid return? Ans. In case of mismatch, the communication would be made to the both parties. If the mismatch is not rectified, then the amount will be added to the output liability of recipient in the return for the month succeeding the month in which discrepancy is communicated. Q 31. Is input tax credit allowed only after matching?
Ans. No, input tax credit is allowed provisionally for two months. The supply details are matched by the system and discrepancies are communicated to concerned supplier and recipient. In case mismatch continues, the ITC taken would be reversed automatically. Q 32. Can provisionally allowed ITC be used for payment of all liabilities? Ans. No, provisionally allowed ITC can be used only for the payment of self-assessed output tax in the return. Q 33. What will be the tax impact when capital goods on which ITC has been taken are supplied by taxable person? Ans. In case of supply of capital goods or plant and machinery on which input tax credit has been taken, the registered person shall pay an amount equal to the input tax credit taken on the said capital goods or plant and machinery reduced by the percentage points as may be specified in this behalf or the tax on the transaction value of such capital goods, whichever is higher. Q 34. What is the tax implication of supply of capital goods by a registered person who had taken ITC on such capital goods? Ans. The registered person would pay an amount equal to ITC reduced by prescribed percentage point or tax on the transaction value, whichever is higher. But in case of refractory bricks, moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures when these are supplied as scrap, the person can pay tax on the transaction value.
11. Concept of Input Service Distributor in GST Q 1. What is Input Service Distributor (ISD)? Ans. ISD means an office of the supplier of goods or services or both which receives tax invoices towards receipt of input services and issues a prescribed document for the purposes of distributing the credit of central tax (CGST), State tax (SGST)/ Union territory tax (UTGST) or integrated tax (IGST) paid on the said services to a supplier of taxable goods or services or both having same PAN as that of the ISD. Q 2. What are the requirements for registration as ISD? Ans. An ISD is required to obtain a separate registration even though it may be separately registered. The threshold limit of registration is not applicable to ISD. The registration of ISD under the existing regime (i.e. under Service Tax) would not be migrated in GST regime. All the existing ISDs will be required to obtain fresh registration under new regime in case they want to operate as an ISD. Q 3. What are the documents for distribution of credit by ISD? Ans. The distribution of credit would be done through a document especially designed for this purpose. The said document would contain the amount of input tax credit being distributed. Q 4. Can an ISD distribute the input tax credit to all suppliers? Ans. No. The input tax credit of input services shall be
distributed only amongst those registered persons who have used the input services in the course or furtherance of business. Q 5. It is not possible many a times to establish a one-to-one link between quantum of input services used in the course or furtherance of business by a supplier. In such situations, how distribution of ITC by the ISD is to be done? Ans. In such situations, distribution would be based on a formula. Firstly, distribution would be done only amongst those recipients of input tax credit to whom the input service being distributed are attributable. Secondly, distribution would be done amongst the operational units only. Thirdly, distribution would be done in the ratio of turnover in a State or Union territory of the recipient during the period to the aggregate of all recipients to whom input service being distributed is attributable. Lastly, the credit distributed should not exceed the credit available for distribution. Q 6. What does the turnover used for ISD cover? Ans. The turnover for the purpose of ISD does not include any duty or tax levied under entry 84 of List I and entry 51 and 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Q 7. Is the ISD required to file return? Ans. Yes, ISD is required to file monthly return by 13th of the following month. Q 8. Can a company have multiple ISD?
Ans. Yes, different offices like marketing division, security division etc. may apply for separate ISD. Q 9. What are the provisions for recovery of excess/wrongly distributed credit by ISD? Ans. The excess/wrongly distributed credit can be recovered from the recipients of credit along with interest by initiating action under section 73 or 74. Q 10. Whether CGST and IGST credit can be distributed by ISD as IGST credit to recipients located in different States? Ans. Yes, CGST credit can be distributed as IGST and IGST credit can be distributed as CGST by an ISD for the recipients located in different States. Q 11. Whether SGST / UTGST credit can be distributed as IGST credit by an ISD to recipients located in different States? Ans. Yes, an ISD can distribute SGST /UTGST credit as IGST for the recipients located in different States. Q 12. Whether the ISD can distribute the CGST and IGST Credit as CGST credit? Ans. Yes, CGST and IGST credit can be distributed as CGST credit by an ISD for the recipients located in same State. Q 13. Whether the SGST/ UTGST and IGST Credit can be distributed as SGST/UTGST credit? Ans. Yes, ISD can distribute SGST and IGST credit as SGST / UTGST credit for the recipients located in same State. Q 14. How to distribute common credit among all the recipients of an ISD?
Ans. The common credit used by all the recipients can be distributed by ISD on pro rata basis i.e. based on the turnover of each recipient to the aggregate turnover of all the recipients to which credit is distributed. Q 15. The ISD may distribute the CGST and IGST credit to recipient outside the State as_______ (a) IGST (b) CGST (c) SGST Ans. (a) IGST. Q 16. The ISD may distribute the CGST credit within the State as____ (a) IGST (b) CGST (c) SGST (d) Any of the above. Ans. (b) CGST. Q 17. The credit of tax paid on input service used by more than one supplier is ________ (a) Distributed among the suppliers who used such input service on pro rata basis of turnover in such State. (b) Distributed equally among all the suppliers. (c) Distributed only to one supplier. (d) Cannot be distributed. Ans. (a) Distributed among the suppliers who used such
input service on pro rata basis of turnover in such State. Q 18. Whether the excess credit distributed could be recovered from ISD by the department? Ans. No. Excess credit distributed can be recovered along with interest only from the recipient and not ISD. The provisions of section 73 or 74 would be applicable for the recovery of credit. Q 19. What are the consequences of credit distributed in contravention of the provisions of the Act? Ans. The credit distributed in contravention of provisions of Act could be recovered from the recipient to which it is distributed along with interest. *****
12. Returns Process and matching of Input Tax Credit Q 1. What is the purpose of returns? Ans. a) Mode for transfer of information to tax administration; b) Compliance verification program of tax administration; c) Finalization of the tax liabilities of the taxpayer within stipulated period of limitation; to declare tax liability for a given period; d) Providing necessary inputs for taking policy decision; e) Management of audit and anti-evasion programs of tax administration. Q 2. Who needs to file Return in GST regime? Ans. Every person registered under GST will have to file returns in some form or other. A registered person will have to file returns either monthly (normal supplier) or quarterly basis (Supplier opting for composition scheme). An ISD will have to file monthly returns showing details of credit distributed during the particular month. A person required to deduct tax (TDS) and persons required to collect tax (TCS) will also have to file monthly returns showing the amount deducted/collected and other details as may be prescribed. A non-resident taxable person will also have to file returns for the period of activity undertaken. Q 3. What type of outward supply details are to be
filed in the return? Ans. A normal registered taxpayer has to file the outward supply details in GSTR-1 in relation to various types of supplies made in a month, namely outward supplies to registered persons, outward supplies to unregistered persons (consumers), details of Credit/Debit Notes, zero rated, exempted and non-GST supplies, exports, and advances received in relation to future supply. Q 4. Is the scanned copy of invoices to be uploaded along with GSTR-1? Ans. No scanned copy of invoices is to be uploaded. Only certain prescribed fields of information from invoices need to be uploaded. Q 5. Whether all invoices will have to be uploaded? Ans. No. It depends on whether B2B or B2C plus whether Intra-state or Inter-state supplies. For B2B supplies, all invoices, whether Intra-state or Inter- state supplies, will have to be uploaded. Why So? Because ITC will be taken by the recipients, invoice matching is required to be done. In B2C supplies, uploading in general may not be required as the buyer will not be taking ITC. However still in order to implement the destination based principle, invoices of value more than Rs.2.5 lacs in inter-state B2C supplies will have to be uploaded. For inter-state invoices below Rs. 2.5 lacs and all intra-state invoices, state wise summary will be sufficient. Q 6. Whether description of each item in the invoice will have to be uploaded?
Ans. No. In fact, description will not have to be uploaded. Only HSN code in respect of supply of goods and Accounting code in respect of supply of services will have to be fed. The minimum number of digits that the filer will have to upload would depend on his turnover in the last year. Q 7. Whether value for each transaction will have to be fed? What if no consideration? Ans. Yes. Not only value but taxable value will also have to be fed. In some cases, both may be different. In case there is no consideration, but it is supply by virtue of schedule 1, the taxable value will have to be worked out as prescribed and uploaded. Q 8. Can a recipient feed information in his GSTR-2 which has been missed by the supplier? Ans. Yes, the recipient can himself feed the invoices not uploaded by his supplier. The credit on such invoices will also be given provisionally but will be subject to matching. On matching, if the invoice is not uploaded by the supplier, both of them will be intimated. If the mismatch is rectified, provisional credit will be confirmed. But if the mismatch continues, the amount will be added to the output tax liability of the recipient in the returns for the month subsequent to the month in which such discrepancy was communicated. Q 9. Does the taxable person have to feed anything in the GSTR-2 or everything is auto- populated from GSTR-1? Ans. While a large part of GSTR-2 will be auto-populated, there are some details that only recipient can fill like details of imports, details of purchases from non-registered
or composition suppliers and exempt/non-GST/nil GST supplies etc. Q 10. What if the invoices do not match? Whether ITC is to be given or denied? If denied, what action is taken against supplier? Ans. If invoices in GSTR-2 do not match with invoices in counter-party GSTR-1, then such mismatch shall be intimated to the supplier. Mismatch can be because of two reasons. First, it could be due to mistake at the side of the recipient, and in such a case, no further action is required. Secondly, it could be possible that the said invoice was issued by supplier but he did not upload it and pay tax on it. In such a case, the ITC availed by the recipient would be added to his output tax liability, in short, all mismatches will lead to proceedings if the supplier has made a supply but not paid tax on it. Q 11. What will be the legal position in regard to the reversed input tax credit if the supplier later realizes the mistake and feeds the information? Ans. At any stage, but before September of the next financial year, supplier can upload the invoice and pay duty and interest on such missing invoices in his GSTR-3 of the month in which he had earlier failed to upload the invoice. The recipient shall be eligible to reduce his output tax liability to the extent of the amount in respect of which the supplier has rectified the mis-match. The interest paid by the recipient at the time of reversal will also be refunded to the recipient by crediting the amount in corresponding head of his electronic cash ledger. Q 12. What is the special feature of GSTR-2? Ans. The special feature of GSTR-2 is that the details of
supplies received by a recipient can be auto populated on the basis of the details furnished by the counterparty supplier in his GSTR-1. Q 13. Do tax payers under the composition scheme also need to file GSTR-1 and GSTR-2? Ans. No. Composition tax payers do not need to file any statement of outward or inward supplies. They have to file a quarterly return in Form GSTR-4 by the 18th of the month after the end of the quarter. Since they are not eligible for any input tax credit, there is no relevance of GSTR-2 for them and since the credit of tax paid under Composition Levy is not eligible, there is no relevance of GSTR-1 for them. In their return, they have to declare summary details of their outward supplies along with the details of tax payment. They also have to give details of their purchases in their quarterly return itself, most of which will be auto populated. Q 14. Do Input Service Distributors (ISDs) need to file separate statement of outward and inward supplies with their return? Ans. No, the ISDs need to file only a return in Form GSTR- 6 and the return has the details of credit received by them from the service provider and the credit distributed by them to the recipient units. Since their return itself covers these aspects, there is no requirement to file separate statement of inward and outward supplies. Q 15. How does a taxpayer get the credit of the tax deducted at source on his behalf? Does he need to produce TDS certificate from the deductee to get the credit? Ans. Under GST, the deductor will be submitting the
deductee wise details of all the deductions made by him in his return in Form GSTR-7 to be filed by 10th of the month next to the month in which deductions were made. The details of the deductions as uploaded by the deductor shall be auto populated in the GSTR-2 of the deductee. The taxpayer shall be required to confirm these details in his GSTR-2 to avail the credit for deductions made on his behalf. To avail this credit, he does not require to produce any certificate in physical or electronic form. The certificate will only be for record keeping of the tax payer and can be downloaded from the Common Portal. Q 16. Which type of taxpayers need to file Annual Return? Ans. All taxpayers filing return in GSTR-1 to GSTR-3, other than ISD’s, casual/non-resident taxpayers, taxpayers under composition scheme, TDS/TCS deductors, are required to file an annual return. Casual taxpayers, non- resident taxpayers, ISDs and persons authorized to deduct/collect tax at source are not required to file annual return. Q 17. Is an Annual Return and a Final Return one and the same? Ans. No. Annual Return has to be filed by every registered person paying tax as a normal taxpayer. Final Return has to be filed only by those registered persons who have applied for cancellation of registration. The Final return has to be filed within three months of the date of cancellation or the date of cancellation order. Q 18. If a return has been filed, how can it be revised
if some changes are required to be made? Ans. In GST since the returns are built from details of individual transactions, there is no requirement for having a revised return. Any need to revise a return may arise due to the need to change a set of invoices or debit/ credit notes. Instead of revising the return already submitted, the system will allow changing the details of those transactions (invoices or debit/credit notes) that are required to be amended. They can be amended in any of the future GSTR- 1/2 in the tables specifically provided for the purposes of amending previously declared details. Q 19. How can taxpayers file their returns? Ans. Taxpayers will have various modes to file the statements and returns. Firstly, they can file their statement and returns directly on the Common Portal online. However, this may be tedious and time consuming for taxpayers with large number of invoices. For such taxpayers, an offline utility will be provided that can be used for preparing the statements offline after downloading the auto populated details and uploading them on the Common Portal. GSTN has also developed an ecosystem of GST Suvidha Providers (GSP) that will integrate with the Common Portal. Q 20. What precautions, a taxpayer is required to take for a hassle free compliance under GST? Ans. One of the most important things under GST will be timely uploading of the details of outward supplies in Form GSTR-1 by 10th of next month. How best this can be ensured will depend on the number of B2B invoices that the taxpayer issues. If the number is small, the taxpayer can upload all the information in one go. However, if the number of invoices is
large, the invoices (or debit/ credit notes) should be uploaded on a regular basis. GSTN will allow regular uploading of invoices even on a real time basis. Till the statement is actually submitted, the system will also allow the taxpayer to modify the uploaded invoices. Therefore, it would always be beneficial for the taxpayers to regularly upload the invoices. Last minute rush will make uploading difficult and will come with higher risk of possible failure and default. The second thing would be to ensure that taxpayers follow up on uploading the invoices of their inward supplies by their suppliers. This would be helpful in ensuring that the input tax credit is available without any hassle and delay. Recipients can also encourage their suppliers to upload their invoices on a regular basis instead of doing it on or close to the due date. The system would allow recipients to see if their suppliers have uploaded invoices pertaining to them. The GSTN system will also provide the track record about the compliance level of a tax payer, especially about his track record in respect of timely uploading of his supply invoices giving details about the auto reversals that have happened for invoices issued by a supplier. The Common Portal of GST would have pan India data at one place which will enable valuable services to the taxpayers. Efforts are being made to make regular uploading of invoices as easy as possible and it is expected that an enabling eco- system will be developed to achieve this objective. Taxpayers should make efficient use of this ecosystem for easy and hassle free compliance under GST. Q 21. Is it compulsory for a taxpayer to file return by himself? Ans.

13. Assessment and Audit Q 1. Who is the person responsible to make assessment of taxes payable under the Act? Ans. Every person registered under the Act shall himself assess the tax payable by him for a tax period and after such assessment he shall file the return required under section 39. Q 2. When can a taxable person pay tax on a provisional basis? Ans. As a taxpayer has to pay tax on self-assessment basis, a request for paying tax on provisional basis has to come from the taxpayer which will then have to be permitted by the proper officer. In other words, no tax officer can suo-moto order payment of tax on provisional basis. This is governed by section 60 of CGST/SGST Act. Tax can be paid on a provisional basis only after the proper officer has permitted it through an order passed by him. For this purpose, the taxable person has to make a written request to the proper officer, giving reasons for payment of tax on a provisional basis. Such a request can be made by the taxable person only in such cases where he is unable to determine: a) the value of goods or services to be supplied by him, or b) determine the tax rate applicable to the goods or services to be supplied by him. In such cases the taxable person has to execute a bond in the prescribed form, and with such surety or security as the proper officer may deem fit.
Q 3. What is the latest time by which final assessment is required to be made? Ans. The final assessment order has to be passed by the proper officer within six months from the date of the communication of the order of provisional assessment. However, on sufficient cause being shown and for reasons to be recorded in writing, the above period of six months may be extended: a) by the Joint / Additional Commissioner for a further period not exceeding six months, and b) by the Commissioner for such further period as he may deem fit not exceeding fours. Thus, a provisional assessment can remain provisional for a maximum of five years. Q 4. Where the tax liability as per the final assessment is higher than in provisional assessment, will the taxable person be liable to pay interest? Ans. Yes. He will be liable to pay interest from the date the tax was due to be paid originally till the date of actual payment. Q 5. What recourse may be taken by the officer in case proper explanation is not furnished for the discrepancy detected in the return filed, while conducting scrutiny under section 61 of CGST ACT? Ans. If the taxable person does not provide a satisfactory explanation within 30 days of being informed (extendable by the officer concerned) or after accepting discrepancies, fails to take corrective action in the return for the month in which the discrepancy is accepted, the Proper Officer may take recourse to any of the following provisions:
(a) Proceed to conduct audit under Section 65 of the Act; (b) Direct the conduct of a special audit under Section 66 which is to be conducted by a Chartered Accountant or a Cost Accountant nominated for this purpose by the Commissioner; or (c) Undertake procedures of inspection, search and seizure under Section 67 of the Act; or (d) Initiate proceeding for determination of tax and other dues under Section 73 or 74 of the Act. Q 6. If a taxable person fails to file the return required under law (under section 39 (monthly/quarterly), or 45 (final return), what legal recourse is available to the tax officer? Ans. The proper officer has to first issue a notice to the defaulting taxable person under section 46 of CGST/SGST Act requiring him to furnish the return within a period of fifteen days. If the taxable person fails to file return within the given time, the proper officer shall proceed to assess the tax liability of the return defaulter to the best of his judgement taking into account all the relevant material available with him. (Section 62). Q 7. Under what circumstances can a best judgment assessment order issued under section 60 be withdrawn? Ans. The best judgment order passed by the Proper Officer under section 62 of CGST/SGST Act shall automatically stand withdrawn if the taxable person
furnishes a valid return for the default period (i.e. files the return and pays the tax as assessed by him), within thirty days of the receipt of the best judgment assessment order. Q 8. What is the time limit for passing assessment order u/s 62 (Best Judgment) and 63 (Non-filers)? Ans. The time limit for passing an assessment order under section 62 or 63 is five years from the due date for furnishing the annual return. Q 9. What is the legal recourse available in respect of a person who is liable to pay tax but has failed to obtain registration? Ans. Section 63 of CGST/SGST Act provides that in such a case, the proper officer can assess the tax liability and pass an order to his best judgment for the relevant tax periods. However, such an order must be passed within a period of five years from the due date for furnishing the annual return for the financial year to which non-payment of tax relates. Q 10. Under what circumstances can a tax officer initiate Summary Assessment? Ans. As per section 64 of CGST/SGST Act, Summary Assessments can be initiated to protect the interest of revenue when: a) the proper officer has evidence that a taxable person has incurred a liability to pay tax under the Act, and b) the proper officer believes that delay in passing an assessment order will adversely affect the interest of revenue.
Such order can be passed after seeking permission from the Additional Commissioner / Joint Commissioner. Q 11. Other than appellate remedy, is there any other recourse available to the taxpayer against a summary assessment order? Ans. A taxable person against whom a summary assessment order has been passed can apply for its withdrawal to the jurisdictional Additional/Joint Commissioner within thirty days of the date of receipt of the order. If the said officer finds the order erroneous, he can withdraw it and direct the proper officer to carry out determination of tax liability in terms of section 73 or 74 of CGST/SGST Act. The Additional/Joint Commissioner can follow a similar course of action on his own motion if he finds the summary assessment order to be erroneous (section 64 of CGST/SGST Act). Q 12. Is summary assessment order to be necessarily passed against the taxable person? Ans. No. In certain cases, like when goods are under transportation or are stored in a warehouse, and the taxable person in respect of such goods cannot be ascertained, the person in charge of such goods shall be deemed to be the taxable person and will be assessed to tax (proviso to Section 64 of CGST/SGST Act).

In how much time will the Authority for Advance Rulings have to pronounce its ruling? Ans. As per Section 98(6) of CGST/SGST Act, the Authority shall pronounce its ruling in writing within ninety days from the date of receipt of application. Q 8.

There will be one AAR and AAAR for each State. Q 10. To whom will the Advance Ruling be applicable? Ans. Section 103 provides that an advance ruling
pronounced by AAR or AAAR shall be binding only on the applicant who sought it in respect of any matter referred to in 97 (2) and on the jurisdictional tax authority of the applicant. This clearly means that an advance ruling is not applicable to similarly placed taxable persons in the State. It is only limited to the person who has applied for an advance ruling. Q 11. Whether the advance ruling have precedent value of a judgment of the High Court or the Supreme Court? Ans. No, the advance ruling is binding only in respect of the matter referred. It has no precedent value. However, even for persons other than applicant, it does have persuasive value. Q 12. What is the time period for applicability of Advance Ruling? Ans. The law does not provide for a fixed time period for which the ruling shall apply. Instead, in section 103(2), it is provided that advance ruling shall be binding till the period when the law, facts or circumstances supporting the original advance ruling have changed. Thus, a ruling shall continue to be in force so long as the transaction continues and so long as there is no change in law, facts or circumstances. Q 13. Can an advance ruling given be nullified? Ans. Section 104(1) provides that an advance ruling shall be held to be ab initio void if the AAR or AAAR finds that
the advance ruling was obtained by the applicant by fraud or suppression of material facts or misrepresentation of facts. In such a situation, all the provisions of the GST Act(s) shall apply to the applicant as if such advance ruling had never been made (but excluding the period when advance ruling was given and up to the period when the order declaring it to be void is issued). An order declaring advance ruling to be void can be passed only after hearing the applicant. Q 14. What is the procedure for obtaining Advance Ruling? Ans. Section 97 and 98 deals with procedure for obtaining advance ruling. Section 97 provides that the applicant desirous of obtaining advance ruling should make application to AAR in a prescribed form and manner. The format of the form and the detailed procedure for making application will be prescribed in the Rules. Section 98 provides the procedure for dealing with the application for advance ruling. The AAR shall send a copy of application to the officer in whose jurisdiction the applicant falls and call for all relevant records. The AAR may then examine the application along with the records and may also hear the applicant. Thereafter AAR will pass an order either admitting or rejecting the application. Q 15. Under what circumstances will the application for Advance Ruling be compulsorily rejected? Ans. Application has to be rejected if the question raised in the application is already pending or decided in any proceedings in the case of applicant under any of the provisions of GST Act(s) If the application is rejected, it should be by way of a
speaking order giving the reasons for rejection. Q 16. What is the procedure to be followed by AAR once the application is admitted? Ans. If the application is admitted, the AAR shall pronounce its ruling within ninety days of receipt of application. Before giving its ruling, it shall examine the application and any further material furnished by the applicant or by the concerned departmental officer. Before giving the ruling, AAR must hear the applicant or his authorized representative as well as the jurisdictional officers of CGST/SGST/UTGST. Q 17. What happens if there is a difference of opinion amongst members of AAR? Ans. If there is difference of opinion between the two members of AAR, they shall refer the point or points on which they differ to the AAAR for hearing the issue. If the members of AAAR are also unable to come to a common conclusion in regard to the point(s) referred to them by AAR, then it shall be deemed that no advance ruling can be given in respect of the question on which difference persists at the level of AAAR. Q 18. What are the provisions for appeals against order of AAR? Ans. The provisions of appeal before AAAR are dealt in section 100 and 101 of CGST/SGST Act or section 14 of the UTGST Act. If the applicant is aggrieved with the finding of the AAR, he can file an appeal with AAAR. Similarly, if the concerned
or jurisdictional officer of CGST/SGST/UTGST does not agree with the finding of AAR, he can also file an appeal with AAAR. The word concerned officer of CGST/SGST means an officer who has been designated by the CGST/SGST administration in regard to an application for advance ruling. In normal circumstances, the concerned officer will be the officer in whose jurisdiction the applicant is located. In such cases the concerned officer will be the jurisdictional CGST/SGST officer. Any appeal must be filed within thirty days from the receipt of the advance ruling. The appeal has to be in prescribed form and has to be verified in prescribed manner. This will be prescribed in the Model GST Rules. The Appellate Authority must pass an order after hearing the parties to the appeal within a period of ninety days of the filing of an appeal. If members of AAAR differ on any point referred to in appeal, it shall be deemed that no advance ruling is issued in respect of the question under appeal. Q 19. Whether Appeal can be filed before High Court or Supreme Court against the ruling of Appellate Authority for Advance Rulings? Ans The CGST /SGST Act do not provide for any appeal against the ruling of Appellate Authority for Advance Rulings. Thus no further appeals lie and the ruling shall be binding on the applicant as well as the jurisdictional officer in respect of applicant. However, Writ Jurisdiction may lie before Hon’ble High Court or the Supreme Court.
Q 20. Can the AAR & AAAR order for rectification of mistakes in the ruling? Ans. Yes, AAR and AAAR have power to amend their order to rectify any mistake apparent from the record within a period of six months from the date of the order. Such mistake may be noticed by the authority on its own accord or may be brought to its notice by the applicant or the concerned or the jurisdictional CGST/SGST officer. If a rectification has the effect of enhancing the tax liability or reducing the quantum of input tax credit, the applicant or the appellant must be heard before the order is passed. (Section 102)

19. Inspection, Search, Seizure and Arrest Q 1. What is the meaning of the term “Search”? Ans. As per law dictionary and as noted in different judicial pronouncements, the term ‘search’, in simple language, denotes an action of a government machinery to go, look through or examine carefully a place, area, person, object etc. in order to find something concealed or for the purpose of discovering evidence of a crime. The search of a person or vehicle or premises etc. can only be done under proper and valid authority of law. Q 2. What is the meaning of the term “Inspection”? Ans. ‘Inspection’ is a new provision under the CGST/SGST Act. It is a softer provision than search to enable officers to access any place of business of a taxable person and also any place of business of a person engaged in transporting goods or who is an owner or an operator of a warehouse or godown. Q 3. Who can order for carrying out “Inspection” and under what circumstances? Ans. As per Section 67 of CGST/SGST Act, Inspection can be carried out by an officer of CGST/SGST only upon a written authorization given by an officer of the rank of Joint Commissioner or above. A Joint Commissioner or an officer higher in rank can give such authorization only if he has reasons to believe that the person concerned has done one of the following: i. suppressed any transaction of supply;
ii. suppressed stock of goods in hand; iii. claimed excess input tax credit; iv. contravened any provision of the CGST/SGST Act to evade tax; v. a transporter or warehouse owner has kept goods which have escaped payment of tax or has kept his accounts or goods in a manner that is likely to cause evasion of tax. Q 4. Can the proper officer authorize Inspection of any assets/premises of any person under this Section? Ans. No. Authorization can be given to an officer of CGST/ SGST to carry out inspection of any of the following: i. any place of business of a taxable person; ii. any place of business of a person engaged in the business of transporting goods whether or not he is a registered taxable person; iii. any place of business of an owner or an operator of a warehouse or godown. Q 5. Who can order for Search and Seizure under the provisions of CGST Act? Ans. An officer of the rank of Joint Commissioner or above can authorize an officer in writing to carry out search and seize goods, documents, books or things. Such authorization can be given only where the Joint Commissioner has reasons to believe that any goods liable to confiscation or any documents or books or things relevant for any proceedings are hidden in any place. Q 6. What is meant by ‘reasons to believe’? Ans. Reason to believe is to have knowledge of facts
which, although not amounting to direct knowledge, would cause a reasonable person, knowing the same facts, to reasonably conclude the same thing. As per Section 26 of the IPC, 1860, “A person is said to have ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise.” ‘Reason to believe’ contemplates an objective determination based on intelligent care and evaluation as distinguished from a purely subjective consideration. It has to be and must be that of an honest and reasonable person based on relevant material and circumstances. Q 7. Is it mandatory that such ‘reasons to believe’ has to be recorded in writing by the proper officer, before issuing authorization for Inspection or Search and Seizure? Ans. Although the officer is not required to state the reasons for such belief before issuing an authorization for search, he has to disclose the material on which his belief was formed. ‘Reason to believe’ need not be recorded invariably in each case. However, it would be better if the materials / information etc. are recorded before issue of search warrant or before conducting search. Q 8. What is a Search Warrant and what are its contents? Ans. The written authority to conduct search is generally called search warrant. The competent authority to issue search warrant is an officer of the rank of Joint Commissioner or above. A search warrant must indicate the existence of a reasonable belief leading to the search. Search Warrant should contain the following details:
i. the violation under the Act, ii. the premise to be searched, iii. the name and designation of the person authorized for search, iv. the name of the issuing officer with full designation along with his round seal, v. date and place of issue, vi. serial number of the search warrant, vii. period of validity i.e. a day or two days etc. Q 9. When do goods become liable to confiscation under the provisions of CGST/SGST Act? Ans. As per section 130 of SGST/SGST Act, goods become liable to confiscation when any person does the following: (i) supplies or receives any goods in contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or rules made thereunder leading to evasion of tax; (ii) does not account for any goods on which he is liable to pay tax under this Act; (iii) supplies any goods liable to tax under this Act without having applied for the registration; (iv) contravenes any of the provisions of the CGST/ SGST Act or rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of tax. Q 10. What powers can be exercised by an officer during valid search? Ans. An officer carrying out a search has the power to search for and seize goods (which are liable to confiscation) and documents, books or things (relevant for any proceedings
under CGST/SGST Act) from the premises searched. During search, the officer has the power to break open the door of the premises authorized to be searched if access to the same is denied. Similarly, while carrying out search within the premises, he can break open any almirah or box if access to such almirah or box is denied and in which any goods, account, registers or documents are suspected to be concealed. He can also seal the premises if access to it denied. Q 11. What is the procedure for conducting search? Ans. Section 67(10) of CGST/SGST Act prescribes that searches must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure describes the procedure for search. Q 12. What are the basic requirements to be observed during Search operations? Ans. The following principles should be observed during Search: • No search of premises should be carried out without a valid search warrant issued by the proper officer. • There should invariably be a lady officer accompanying the search team to residence. • The officers before starting the search should disclose their identity by showing their identity cards to the person in-charge of the premises. • The search warrant should be executed before the start of the search by showing the same to the person in-charge of the premises and his signature should be taken on the body of the search warrant in token of having seen the same. The signatures of
at least two witnesses should also be taken on the body of the search warrant. • The search should be made in the presence of at least two independent witnesses of the locality. If no such inhabitants are available /willing, the inhabitants of any other locality should be asked to be witness to the search. The witnesses should be briefed about the purpose of the search. • Before the start of the search proceedings, the team of officers conducting the search and the accompanying witnesses should offer themselves for their personal search to the person in-charge of the premises being searched. Similarly, after the completion of search all the officers and the witnesses should again offer themselves for their personal search. • A Panchnama / Mahazar of the proceedings of the search should necessarily be prepared on the spot. A list of all goods, documents recovered and seized/detained should be prepared and annexed to the Panchnama/Mahazar. The Panchnama / Mahazar and the list of goods/ documents seized/detained should invariably be signed by the witnesses, the in- charge/ owner of the premises before whom the search is conducted and also by the officer(s) duly authorized for conducting the search. • After the search is over, the search warrant duly executed should be returned in original to the issuing officer with a report regarding the outcome of the search. The names of the officers who participated in the search may also be
written on the reverse of the search warrant. • The issuing authority of search warrant should maintain register of records of search warrant issued and returned and used search warrants should be kept in records. • A copy of the Panchnama / Mahazar along with its annexure should be given to the person in- charge/owner of the premises being searched under acknowledgement. Q 13. Can a CGST/SGST officer access business premises under any other circumstances? Ans. Yes. Access can also be obtained in terms of Section 65 of CGST/SGST Act. This provision of law is meant to allow an audit party of CGST/SGST or C&AG or a cost accountant or chartered accountant nominated under section 66 of CGST/SGST Act, access to any business premises without issuance of a search warrant for the purposes of carrying out any audit, scrutiny, verification and checks as may be necessary to safeguard the interest of revenue. However, a written authorization is to be issued by an officer of the rank of Commissioner of CGST or SGST. This provision facilitates access to a business premise which is not registered by a taxable person as a principal or additional place of business but has books of accounts, documents, computers etc. which are required for audit or verification of accounts of a taxable person. Q 14. What is meant by the term ‘Seizure’? Ans. The term ‘seizure’ has not been specifically defined in the Model GST Law. In Law Lexicon Dictionary, ‘seizure’ is defined as the act of taking possession of property by an officer under legal process. It generally implies taking
possession forcibly contrary to the wishes of the owner of the property or who has the possession and who was unwilling to part with the possession. Q 15. Does GST Act(s) have any power of detention of goods and conveyances? Ans. Yes, under Section 129 of CGST/SGST Act, an officer has power to detain goods along with the conveyance (like a truck or other types of vehicle) transporting the goods. This can be done for such goods which are being transported or are stored in transit in violation of the provisions of CGST/SGST Act. Goods which are stored or are kept in stock but not accounted for can also be detained. Such goods and conveyance shall be released after payment of applicable tax or upon furnishing security of equivalent amount. Q 16. What is the distinction in law between ‘Seizure’ and ‘Detention’? Ans. Denial of access to the owner of the property or the person who possesses the property at a particular point of time by a legal order/notice is called detention. Seizure is taking over of actual possession of the goods by the department. Detention order is issued when it is suspected that the goods are liable to confiscation. Seizure can be made only on the reasonable belief which is arrived at after inquiry/investigation that the goods are liable to confiscation. Q 17. What are the safeguards provided in GST Act(s) in respect of Search or Seizure? Ans. Certain safeguards are provided in section 67 of
CGST/SGST Act in respect of the power of search or seizure. These are as follows: i. Seized goods or documents should not be retained beyond the period necessary for their examination; ii. Photocopies of the documents can be taken by the person from whose custody documents are seized; iii. For seized goods, if a notice is not issued within six months of its seizure, goods shall be returned to the person from whose possession it was seized. This period of six months can be extended on justified grounds up to a further period of maximum six months; iv. An inventory of seized goods shall be made by the seizing officer; v. Certain categories of goods to be specified under CGST Rules (such as perishable, hazardous etc.) can be disposed of immediately after seizure; vi. Provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 relating to search and seizure shall apply. However, one important modification is in relation to sub-section (5) of section 165 of Code of Criminal Procedure – instead of sending copies of any record made in course of search to the nearest Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence, it has to be sent to the Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner of CGST/ Commissioner of SGST. Q 18. Is there any special document required to be carried during transport of taxable goods?
Ans. Under section 68 of CGST /SGST Act, a person in charge of a conveyance carrying any consignment of goods of value exceeding a specified amount may be required to carry a prescribed document as may be prescribed. Q 19. What is meant by the term “arrest”? Ans. The term ‘arrest’ has not been defined in the CGST/SGST Act. However, as per judicial pronouncements, it denotes ‘the taking into custody of a person under some lawful command or authority’. In other words, a person is said to be arrested when he is taken and restrained of his liberty by power or colour of lawful warrant. Q 20. When can the proper officer authorize ‘arrest’ of any person under CGST / SGST Act? Ans. The Commissioner of CGST/SGST can authorize a CGST/SGST officer to arrest a person if he has reasons to believe that the person has committed an offence attracting a punishment prescribed under section 132(1) (a), (b), (c), (d) or Sec 132(2) of the CGST/SGST Act. This essentially means that a person can be arrested only where the tax evasion is more than 2 crore rupees or where a he has been convicted earlier under CGST Act. Q 21. What are the safeguards provided under CGST /SGST Act for a person who is placed under arrest? Ans. There are certain safeguards provided under section 69 for a person who is placed under arrest. These are: a. If a person is arrested for a cognizable
offence, he must be informed in writing of the grounds of arrest and he must be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest; i. If a person is arrested for a non- cognizable and bailable offence, the Deputy/ Assistant Commissioner of CGST/SGST can release him on bail and he will be subject to the same provisions as an officer in-charge of a police station under section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973; ii. All arrest must be in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 relating to arrest. Q 22. What are the precautions to be taken during arrest? Ans. The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) relating to arrest and the procedure thereof must be adhered to. It is therefore necessary that all field officers of CGST/SGST be fully familiar with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. One important provision to be taken note of is section 57 of Cr.P.C., 1973 which provides that a person arrested without warrant shall not be detained for a longer period than, under the circumstances of the case, is reasonable but this shall not exceed twenty four hours (excluding the journey time from place of arrest to the Magistrate’s court). Within this period, as provided under section 56 of Cr.P.C., the person making the arrest shall send the person arrested without warrant before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. In a landmark judgment in the case of D.K. Basu v. State
of West Bengal reported in 1997 (1) SCC 416, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down specific guidelines required to be followed while making arrests. While this is in relation to police, it needs to be followed by all departments having power of arrest. These are as under: i. The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations. The particulars of all such police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register. ii. The police officer carrying out the arrest shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest and such memo shall be attested by at least one witness, who may be either a member of the family of the arrestee or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made. It shall also be counter signed by the arrestee and shall contain the time and date of arrest. iii. A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a police station or interrogation center or other lock up, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed, as soon as practicable, that he has been arrested and is being detained at the particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee. iv. The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the police where the next friend or relative of the arrestee lives outside the district or town through the Legal Aid
Organization in the District and the police station of the area concerned telegraphically within a period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest. v.

Q 23. What are the broad guidelines for arrest followed in CBEC? Ans. Decision to arrest needs to be taken on case-to- case basis considering various factors, such as, nature and gravity of offence, quantum of duty evaded or credit wrongfully availed, nature and quality of evidence, possibility of evidences being tampered with or witnesses being influenced, cooperation with the investigation, etc. Power to arrest has to be exercised after careful consideration of the facts of the case which may include: i. to ensure proper investigation of the offence; ii. to prevent such person from absconding; iii. cases involving organized smuggling of goods or evasion of customs duty by way of concealment; iv. master minds or key operators effecting proxy/ benami imports/exports in the name of dummy or non-existent persons/IECs, etc.; v. where the intent to evade duty is evident and element of mensrea/guilty mind is palpable; vi. prevention of the possibility of tampering with evidence; vii. intimidating or influencing witnesses; and viii. large amounts of evasion of duty or service tax at least exceeding one crore rupees. Q 24. What is a cognizable offence?
Ans. Generally, as per Cr. PC, cognizable offence means serious category of offences in respect of which a police officer has the authority to make an arrest without a warrant and to start an investigation with or without the permission of a court. However, GST being a special legislation, only the officers, duly empowered under the Act can act as above. Q 25. What is a non-cognizable offence? Ans. Non-cognizable offence means relatively less serious offences in respect of which a police officer does not have the authority to make an arrest without a warrant and an investigation cannot be initiated without a court order, except as may be authorized under special legislation. Q 26. What are cognizable and non-cognizable offences under CGST Act? Ans. In section 132 of CGST Act, it is provided that the offences relating to taxable goods and /or services where the amount of tax evaded or the amount of input tax credit wrongly availed or the amount of refund wrongly taken exceeds Rs. 5 crore, shall be cognizable and non- bailable. Other offences under the act are non-cognizable and bailable. Q 27. When can the proper officer issue summons under CGST Act? Ans. Section 70 of CGST/SGST Act gives powers to a duly authorized CGST/SGST officer to call upon a person by issuing a summon to present himself before the officer issuing the summon to either give evidence or produce a document or any other thing in any inquiry which an officer is making. A summons to produce documents or other things may be for the production of certain specified
documents or things or for the production of all documents or things of a certain description in the possession or under the control of the person summoned. Q 28. What are the responsibilities of the person so summoned? Ans. A person who is issued summon is legally bound to attend either in person or by an authorized representative and he is bound to state the truth before the officer who has issued the summon upon any subject which is the subject matter of examination and to produce such documents and other things as may be required. Q 29. What can be the consequences of non- appearance to summons? Ans. The proceeding before the official who has issued summons is deemed to be a judicial proceeding. If a person does not appear on the date when summoned without any reasonable justification, he can be prosecuted under section 174 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). If he absconds to avoid service of summons, he can be prosecuted under section 172 of the IPC and in case he does not produce the documents or electronic records required to be produced, he can be prosecuted under section 175 of the IPC. In case he gives false evidence, he can be prosecuted under section 193 of the IPC. In addition, if a person does not appear before a CGST/ SGST officer who has issued the summon, he is liable to a penalty up to Rs 25,000/- under section 122(3)(d) of CGST/SGST Act. Q 30. What are the guidelines for issue of summons? Ans. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)
in the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance has issued guidelines from time to time to ensure that summons provisions are not misused in the field. Some of the important highlights of these guidelines are given below: i. summons are to be issued as a last resort where assesses are not co-operating and this section should not be used for the top management; ii. the language of the summons should not be harsh and legal which causes unnecessary mental stress and embarrassment to the receiver; iii. summons by Superintendents should be issued after obtaining prior written permission from an officer not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner with the reasons for issuance of summons to be recorded in writing; iv. where for operational reasons, it is not possible to obtain such prior written permission, oral/ telephonic permission from such officer must be obtained and the same should be reduced to writing and intimated to the officer according such permission at the earliest opportunity; v. in all cases, where summons are issued, the officer issuing summons should submit a report or should record a brief of the proceedings in the case file and submit the same to the officer who had authorized the issuance of summons; vi. senior management officials such as CEO, CFO, General Managers of a large company or a Public Sector Undertaking should not generally be issued summons at the first instance. They should be summoned only when there are indications in the investigation of their involvement in the
decision making process which led to loss of revenue. Q 31. What are the precautions to be observed while issuing summons? Ans. The following precautions should generally be observed when summoning a person: - (i) A summon should not be issued for appearance where it is not justified. The power to summon can be exercised only when there is an inquiry being undertaken and the attendance of the person is considered necessary. (ii) Normally, summons should not be issued repeatedly. As far as practicable, the statement of the accused or witness should be recorded in minimum number of appearances. (iii) Respect the time of appearance given in the summons. No person should be made to wait for long hours before his statement is recorded except when it has been decided very consciously as a matter of strategy. (iv) Preferably, statements should be recorded during office hours; however, an exception could be made regarding time and place of recording statement having regard to the facts in the case. Q 32. Are there any class of officers who are required to assist CGST/SGST officers? Ans. Under section 72 of CGST/SGST Act, the following officers have been empowered and are required to assist CGST/SGST officers in the execution of CGST/SGST Act.

Section 126 further specifies that, in particular, no substantial penalty is to be imposed for —
• any minor breach (minor breach has been defined as a violation of the provisions in a case where the tax involved is less than Rs.5000), or • a procedural requirement of the law, or • an easily rectifiable mistake/omission in documents (explained in the law as an error apparent on record) that has been made without fraudulent intent or gross negligence. Further, wherever penalty of a fixed amount or a fixed percentage has been provided in the CGST/SGST Act, the same shall apply. Q 4. What is the quantum of penalty provided for in the CGST /SGST Act? Ans. Section 122(1) provides that any taxable person who has committed any of the offences mentioned in section 122 shall be punished with a penalty that shall be higher of the following amounts: • The amount of tax evaded, fraudulently obtained as refund, availed as credit, or not deducted or collected or short deducted or short collected, or • A sum of Rs. 10,000/-.

then such goods shall be liable for detention along with any vehicle on which they are being transported. Where owner comes forward: - Such goods shall be released on payment of the applicable tax and penalty equal to 100% tax or upon furnishing of security equivalent to the said amount. In case of exempted goods, penalty is 2% of value of goods or Rs 25,000/- whichever is lesser. Where owner does not come forward: - Such goods shall be released on payment of the applicable tax and penalty equal to 50% of value of goods or upon furnishing of security equivalent to the said amount. In case of exempted goods, penalty is 5% of value of goods or Rs 25,000/- whichever is lesser. Q 7. What is the penalty prescribed for a person who opts for composition scheme despite being ineligible for the said scheme? Ans. Section 10(5) provides that if a person who has paid under composition levy is found as not being eligible for compounding then such person shall be liable to penalty to an amount equivalent to the tax payable by him under the provisions of the Act i.e. as a normal taxable person and that this penalty shall be in addition to the tax payable by him. Q 8. What is meant by confiscation? Ans. The word ‘confiscation’ has not been defined in the Act. The concept is derived from Roman Law wherein it meant seizing or taking into the hands of emperor, and transferring to Imperial “fiscus” or Treasury. The word “confiscate” has been defined in Aiyar’s Law Lexicon as to
“appropriate (private property) to the public treasury by way of penalty; to deprive of property as forfeited to the State.” In short in means transfer of the title to the goods to the Government.

Q 10. What happens to the goods upon confiscation of goods by the proper officer? Ans. Upon confiscation, the title in the confiscated goods shall vest in the Government and every Police officer to whom the proper officer makes a request in this behalf, shall assist in taking possession of the goods. Q 11. After confiscation, is it required to give option
to the person to redeem the goods? Ans. Yes. In terms of section 130(2), the Owner or the person in-charge of the goods liable to confiscation is to be given the option for fine (not exceeding market price of confiscated goods) in lieu of confiscation. This fine shall be in addition to the tax and other charges payable in respect of such goods. Q 12. Can any conveyance carrying goods without cover of prescribed documents be subject to confiscation? Ans. Yes. Section 130 provides that any conveyance carrying goods without the cover of any documents or declaration prescribed under the Act shall be liable to confiscation. However, if the owner of the conveyance proves that the goods were being transported without cover of the required documents/declarations without his knowledge or connivance or without the knowledge or connivance of his agent then the conveyance shall not be liable to confiscation as aforesaid. Q 13. What is Prosecution? Ans. Prosecution is the institution or commencement of legal proceeding; the process of exhibiting formal charges against the offender. Section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code defines “prosecution” as the institution and carrying on of the legal proceedings against a person. Q 14.

21. Overview of the IGST Act Q 1. What is IGST? Ans. “Integrated Goods and Services Tax” (IGST) means tax levied under the IGST Act on the supply of any goods and/ or services in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Q 2. What are inter-state supplies? Ans. A supply of goods and/or services in the course of inter-State trade or commerce means any supply where the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in different States, two different union territory or in a state and union territory Further import of goods and services, supplies to SEZ units or developer, or any supply that is not an intra state supply. (Section 7 of the IGST Act). Q 3. How will the Inter-State supplies of Goods and Services be taxed under GST? Ans. IGST shall be levied and collected by Centre on inter- state supplies. IGST would be broadly CGST plus SGST and shall be levied on all inter-State taxable supplies of goods and services. The inter-State seller will pay IGST on value addition after adjusting available credit of IGST, CGST, and SGST on his purchases. The Exporting State will transfer to the Centre the credit of SGST used in payment of IGST. The Importing dealer will claim credit of IGST while discharging his output tax liability in his own State. The Centre will transfer to the importing State the credit of IGST used in payment of SGST. The relevant information is also submitted to the Central Agency which will act as a clearing house mechanism, verify the claims and inform the
respective governments to transfer the funds. Q 4. What are the salient features of the draft IGST Law? Ans. The draft IGST law contains 25 sections divided into9 Chapters. The law, inter alia, sets out the rules for determination of the place of supply of goods. Where the supply involves movement of goods, the place of supply shall be the location of goods at the time at which the movement of goods terminates for delivery to the recipient. Where the supply does not involve movement of goods, the place of supply shall be the location of such goods at the time of delivery to the recipient. In the case of goods assembled or installed at site, the place of supply shall be the place of such installation or assembly. Finally, where the goods are supplied on board a conveyance, the place of supply shall be the location at which such goods are taken on board. The law also provides for determination of place of supply of service where both supplier and recipient are located in India (domestic supplies) or where supplier or recipient is located outside India (international supplies). This is discussed in details in the next Chapter. It also provides for certain other specific provisions like payment of tax by online information and database access service provider located outside India to an unregistered person in India, upon taking registration in India, under the IGST Act, following a simplified provision (section 14 of the IGST Act), Q 5. What are the advantages of IGST Model? Ans. The major advantages of IGST Model are:
a. Maintenance of uninterrupted ITC chain on inter- State transactions; b. No upfront payment of tax or substantial blockage of funds for the inter-State seller or buyer; c. No refund claim in exporting State, as ITC is used up while paying the tax; d. Self-monitoring model; e. Ensures tax neutrality while keeping the tax regime simple; f. Simple accounting with no additional compliance burden on the taxpayer; g. Would facilitate in ensuring high level of compliance and thus higher collection efficiency. Model can handle ‘Business to Business’ as well as ‘Business to Consumer’ transactions. Q 6. How will imports/exports be taxed under GST? Ans. All imports/exports will be deemed as inter-state supplies for the purposes of levy of GST (IGST). The incidence of tax will follow the destination principle and the tax revenue in case of SGST will accrue to the State where the imported goods and services are consumed. Full and complete set-off will be available as ITC of the IGST paid on import on goods and services. Exports of goods and services will be zero rated. The exporter has the option either to export under bond without payment of duty and claim refund of ITC or pay IGST at the time of export and claim refund of IGST. The IGST on imports is leviable under the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act and shall be levied at
the time of imports along with the levy of the Customs Act (Section 5 of the IGST Act) Q 7. How will the IGST be paid? Ans. The IGST payment can be done utilizing ITC or by cash. However, the use of ITC for payment of IGST will be done using the following hierarchy, -  First available ITC of IGST shall be used for payment of IGST;  Once ITC of IGST is exhausted, the ITC of CGST shall be used for payment of IGST;  If both ITC of IGST and ITC of CGST are exhausted, then only the dealer would be permitted to use ITC of SGST for payment of IGST. Remaining IGST liability, if any, shall be discharged using payment in cash. GST System will ensure maintenance of this hierarchy for payment of IGST using the credit. Q 8. How will the settlement between Centre, exporting state and importing state be done? Ans. There would be settlement of account between the Centre and the states on two counts, which are as follows- • Centre and the exporting state: The exporting state shall pay the amount equal to the ITC of SGST used by the supplier in the exporting state to the Centre.
• Centre and the importing state: The Centre shall pay the amount equal to the ITC of IGST used by a dealer for payment of SGST on intra- state supplies. The settlement would be on cumulative basis for a state taking into account the details furnished by all the dealer in the settlement period. Similar settlement of amount would also be undertaken between CGST and IGST account. Q 9. What treatment is given to supplies made to SEZ units or developer? Ans: Supplies to SEZ units or developer shall be zero rated in the same manner as done for the physical exports. Supplier shall have option to make supplies to SEZ without payment of taxes and claim refunds of input taxes on such supplies (section 16 of the IGST Act). Q 10. Are business processes and compliance requirement same in the IGST and CGST Acts? Ans: The procedure and compliance requirement are same for processes likes registration, return filing and payment of tax. Further, the IGST act borrows the provisions from the CGST Act as relating to assessment, audit, valuation, time of supply, invoice, accounts, records, adjudication, appeal etc. (Section 20 of the IGST Act)
22. Place of Supply of Goods and Service Q 1. What is the need for the Place of Supply of Goods and Services under GST? Ans. The basic principle of GST is that it should effectively tax the consumption of such supplies at the destination thereof or as the case may at the point of consumption. So place of supply provision determines the place i.e. taxable jurisdiction where the tax should reach. The place of supply determines whether a transaction is intra-state or inter- state. In other words, the place of Supply of Goods or services is required to determine whether a supply is subject to SGST plus CGST in a given State or union territory or else would attract IGST if it is an inter-state supply. Q 2. Why are place of supply provisions different in respect of goods and services? Ans. Goods being tangible do not pose any significant problems for determination of their place of consumption. Services being intangible pose problems w.r.t determination of place of supply mainly due to following factors: (i) The manner of delivery of service could be altered easily. For example, telecom service could change from mostly post-paid to mostly pre-paid; billing address could be changed, billers address could be changed, repair or maintenance of software could be changed from onsite to online; banking services were earlier required customer to go to the bank, now the customer could avail service from anywhere;
(ii) Service provider, service receiver and the service provided may not be ascertainable or may easily be suppressed as nothing tangible moves and there would hardly be a trail; (iii) For supplying a service, a fixed location of service provider is not mandatory and even the service recipient may receive service while on the move. The location of billing could be changed overnight; (iv) Sometime the same element may flow to more than one location, for example, construction or other services in respect of a railway line, a national highway or a bridge on a river which originate in one state and end in the other state. Similarly, a copy right for distribution and exhibition of film could be assigned for many states in single transaction or an advertisement or a programme is broadcasted across the country at the same time. An airline may issue seasonal tickets, containing say 10 leafs which could be used for travel between any two locations in the country. The card issued by Delhi metro could be used by a person located in Noida, or Delhi or Faridabad, without the Delhi metro being able to distinguish the location or journeys at the time of receipt of payment; (v) Services are continuously evolving and would thus continue to pose newer challenges. For example, 15-20 years back no one could have thought of DTH, online information, online banking, online booking of tickets, internet, mobile telecommunication etc. Q 3. What proxies or assumptions in a transaction can be used to determine the place of supply?
Ans. The various element involved in a transaction in services can be used as proxies to determine the place of supply. An assumption or proxy which gives more appropriate result than others for determining the place of supply, could be used for determining the place of supply. The same are discussed below: (a) location of service provider; (b) the location of service receiver; (c) the place where the activity takes place/ place of performance; (d) the place where it is consumed; and (e) the place/person to which actual benefit flows Q 4. What is the need to have separate rules for place of supply in respect of B2B (supplies to registered persons) and B2C (supplies to unregistered persons) transactions? Ans. In respect of B2B transactions, the taxes paid are taken as credit by the recipient so such transactions are just pass through. GST collected on B2B supplies effectively create a liability for the government and an asset for the recipient of such supplies in as much as the recipient is entitled to use the input tax credit for payment of future taxes. For B2B transactions the location of recipient takes care in almost all situations as further credit is to be taken by recipient. The recipient usually further supplies to another customer. The supply is consumed only when a B2B transaction is further converted into B2C transaction. In respect of B2C transactions, the supply is finally consumed

What will be the place of supply for mobile
connection? Can it be the location of supplier? Ans. For domestic supplies: The location of supplier of mobile services cannot be the place of supply as the mobile companies are providing services in multiple states and many of these services are inter-state. The consumption principle will be broken if the location of supplier is taken as place of supply and all the revenue may go to a few states where the suppliers are located. The place of supply for mobile connection would depend on whether the connection is on postpaid or prepaid basis. In case of postpaid connections, the place of supply shall be the location of billing address of the recipient of service.

23. GSTN and Frontend Business Process on GST Portal Q 1. What is GSTN? Ans. Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a not-for- profit, non-government company promoted jointly by the Central and State Governments, which will provide shared IT infrastructure and services to both central and state governments including tax payers and other stakeholders. The Frontend services of Registration, Returns, Payments, etc. to all taxpayers will be provided by GSTN. It will be the interface between the government and the taxpayers. Q 2. What was need to create GSTN? Ans. The GST System Project is a unique and complex IT initiative. It is unique as it seeks, for the first time to establish a uniform interface for the tax payer and a common and shared IT infrastructure between the Centre and States. Currently, the Centre and State indirect tax administrations work under different laws, regulations, procedures and formats and consequently the IT systems work as independent sites. Integrating them for GST implementation would be complex since it would involve integrating the entire indirect tax ecosystem so as to bring all the tax administrations (Centre, State and Union Territories) to the same level of IT maturity with uniform formats and interfaces for taxpayers and other external stakeholders. Besides, GST being a destination based tax, the inter- state trade of goods and services (IGST) would need a robust settlement mechanism amongst the States and the Centre. This is possible only when there is a strong
IT Infrastructure and Service back bone which enables capture, processing and exchange of information amongst the stakeholders (including taxpayers, States and Central Government, Bank and RBI). To achieve these objectives GSTN was created. Q 3. What is the genesis of GSTN? Requirements of strong IT Infrastructure was discussed in the 4th meeting of 2010 of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers held on 21/7/2010. In the said meeting the EC approved creation of an ‘Empowered Group on IT Infrastructure for GST’ (referred to as EG) under the chairmanship of Dr. Nandan Nilekani with Additional Secretary (Rev), Member (B&C) CBEC, DG (Systems), CBEC, FA Ministry of Finance, Member Secretary EC and five state commissioners of Trade Taxes (Maharashtra, Assam, Karnataka, West Bengal and Gujarat) as members. The Group was mandated to suggest, inter alia, the modalities for setting up a National Information Utility (NIU/ SPV) for implementing the Common Portal to be called GST Network (GSTN) and recommend the structure and terms of reference for the NIU/ SPV, detailed implementation strategy and the road map for its creation in addition to other items like training, outreach etc. In March 2010, TAGUP constituted by the Ministry of Finance had recommended that National Information Utilities should be set up as private companies with a public purpose for implementation of large and complex Government IT projects including GST. Mandate of TAGUP was to examine the technological and systemic issues relating to the various IT projects such as GST, TIN, NPS,
etc. The EG had seven meetings between 2nd August 2010 and 8th August 2011 to discuss the modalities. After due deliberations, the EG recommended creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle for implementing the GST System Project. To enable efficient and reliable provision of services in a demanding environment, the EG recommended a non- Government structure for the GSTN SPV with Government equity of 49% (Centre – 24.5% and States – 24.5%) after considering key parameters such as independence of management, strategic control of Government, flexibility in organizational structure, agility in decision making and ability to hire and retain competent human resources. In view of the sensitivity of the role of GSTN and the information that would be available with it, the EG also considered the issue of strategic control of Government over GSTN. The Group recommended that strategic control of the Government over the SPV should be ensured through measures such as composition of the Board, mechanisms of Special Resolution and Shareholders Agreement, induction of Government officers on deputation, and agreements between GSTN SPV and Governments. Also, the shareholding pattern would ensure that the Centre individually and States collectively are the largest stakeholders at 24.5% each. In combination, the Government shareholding at 49% would far exceed that of any single private institution. EG also brought out the need to have technology specification to run this company so that there is 100 percent matching of returns. The business knowledge resides with the officials of Government of India and States. However, professionals with sophisticated technology knowledge will be required to run this company independently, similar to NSDL which is working
professionally and independently. EG also recommended a non-government company as that will have operational freedom. These recommendations were presented before the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers in its 3rd meeting of 2011 held on 19th August 2011 and in the 4th meeting of 2011 of the EC held on 14th Oct 2011. The proposal of the EG on IT infrastructure for GST regarding GSTN and formation of a not-for-profit section 25 company with the strategic control of the Government were approved by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC) in its meeting held on14.10.11. The note of Department of Revenue for setting up a Special Purpose Vehicle to be called Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN-SPV) on the lines mentioned above was considered by the Union Cabinet on 12th April 2012 and approved. The Union cabinet also approved the following: i. Suitable and willing non-government institutions will be identified and firmed up by the Ministry of Finance to invest in GSTN-SPV prior to its incorporation. ii. The strategic control of the Government over the SPV would be ensured through measures such as composition of the Board, mechanisms of Special Resolution and Shareholders Agreement, induction of Government officers on deputation, and agreements between GSTN SPV and Governments. iii. The Board of Directors of GSTN SPV would comprise 14 Directors with 3 Directors from the Centre, 3 from the States, a Chairman of the
Board of Directors appointed through a joint approval mechanism of Centre and States, 3 Directors from private equity stake holders, 3 independent Directors who would be persons of eminence and a CEO of the GSTN SPV selected through an open selection process. iv. Relaxation in relevant rules to enable deputation of Government officers to the GSTN SPV for exercise of strategic control and for bringing in necessary domain expertise. v. GSTN SPV would have a self- sustaining revenue model, where it would be able to levy user charges on the tax payers and the tax authorities availing services. vi. GSTN SPV to be the exclusive national agency responsible for delivering integrated indirect Tax related services involving multiple tax authorities. Accordingly, any other service provider seeking to deliver similar integrated services would be required to enter into a formal arrangement with GSTN SPV for the services. vii. A one- time non- recurring Grant- in aid of Rs. 315 crores from the Central Government towards functioning of the SPV for a three-year period after incorporation. Q 4. What is the equity structure and Revenue Model of GSTN? Ans. (a) Equity Structure: - In compliance of the Cabinet decision, GST Network was registered as a not-for-profit, non-Government, private limited company under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1956 with the following equity structure:
Central Govt 24.5% State Govts 24.5% HDFC 10% HDFC Bank 10% ICICI Bank 10% NSE Strategic Investment Co 10% LIC Housing Finance Ltd 11% The GSTN in its current form was created after taking approval of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers and Union Government after due deliberations over a long period of time. (b) Revenue Model: An amount of 315 Cr. was approved by the Govt. of India as Grants-in-Aid for initial setting up of the GSTN-SPV in 2013. During the period 31.03.2013 to 31.03.2016, an amount of Rs 143.96 Crores was released as Grant-In-Aid to GSTN out of Rs 315 Crores approved by Govt of India. Out of the grant-in-aid received, only Rs. 62.11 Cr was spent during this period in setting of the Company and making it functional. The balance grant was returned to Govt. of India. During FY 2016-17, GSTN has got loan sanctioned from a commercial bank to meet expenditure over setting up the IT Platform to provide services to the Center and States through GST portal and developing the backend for 27 States and Union Territories. The Revenue model for GSTN has been approved by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers under which user charges will be paid by the Centre and States/UTs equally on behalf of taxpayers and other stakeholders for availing services from the GST Portal. The user charges will be shared equally by the Centre and the States. The user charges for States will be apportioned amongst them based on
number of registered taxpayers. Q 5. What services will be rendered by GSTN? Ans. GSTN will render the following services through the Common GST Portal: (a) Registration (including existing taxpayer migration, a process which began on 8th Nov 2016); (b) Payment management including payment Gateways and integration with banking systems; (c) Return filing and processing; (d) Taxpayer management, including account management, notifications, information, and status tracking; (e) Tax authority account and ledger Management; (f) Computation of settlement (including IGST Settlement) between the Centre and States; Clearing house for IGST; (g) Processing and reconciliation of GST on import and integration with EDI systems of Customs; (h) MIS including need based information and business intelligence; (i) Maintenance of interfaces between the Common GST Portal and tax administration systems; (j) Provide training to stakeholders; (k) Provide Analytics and Business Intelligence to tax authorities; and (l) Carry out research and study best practices. Q 6. What is the interface system between GSTN and the States/CBEC? Ans. In GST regime, while taxpayer facing core services of applying for registration, uploading of invoices, filing of return, making tax payments shall be hosted by GST System, all the statutory functions (such as approval of registration, assessment of return, conducting investigation and audit
etc.) shall be conducted by the tax authorities of States and Central governments. Thus, the frontend (GST Portal services) shall be provided by GSTN and the backend modules shall be developed by states and Central Government themselves. However, 27 states (termed as Model-2 states) have asked GSTN to develop their backend modules also. The CBEC and rest of the 9 states (Model 1) have decided to develop and host the back-end modules themselves. For Model 1 states/ CBEC full data (registration, return, payment etc.) submitted by taxpayers will be shared with them for information and analysis as deemed fit by them. Q 7. What will be the role of GSTN in registration? Ans. The application for Registration will be made Online on GST Portal. Some of the key data like PAN, Business Constitution, Aadhaar, CIN/DIN etc. (as applicable) will be validated by the GST Portal online with the respective agency i.e. CBDT, UID, MCA etc., thereby ensuring minimum need for submission of documentation. The application data along with supporting scanned documents shall be sent by GSTN to states/ Centre, which in turn shall send the query, if any, or approval or rejection intimation and digitally signed registration to GSTN for eventual download by the taxpayer. Q 8. What is the role of Infosys in GSTN? Ans. GSTN has engaged M/S Infosys as a single Managed Service Provider (MSP) for the design, development and deployment of GST system, including all application software, tools and Infrastructure and for operating &
maintaining the system for a period of 5 years from the Go-Live date. Q 9. What are the basic features of GST common portal? Ans. The GST portal (www.gst.gov.in ) is accessible over Internet (by Taxpayers and their CAs/Tax Advocates etc.) and Intranet by Tax Officials etc. The portal is going to be one single common portal for all GST related services e.g.– i. Tax payer registration (New, surrender, cancelation, amendment etc.); ii. Invoice upload, auto-drafting of Purchase register of buyer, GST Returns filing on stipulated dates for each type of return (GSTR [1,2,3,5, 9.etc]; iii. Tax payment by creation of Challan and integration with agency Banks; iv. ITC and Cash Ledger and Liability Register; v. MIS reporting for tax payers, tax officials and other stakeholders; vi. BI/Analytics for Tax officials. Q 10. What is the concept of GST Eco-system? Ans. A common GST system will provide linkage to all State/UT Commercial Tax departments, Central Tax authorities, Taxpayers, Banks and other stakeholders. The eco-system consists of all stakeholders starting from taxpayer to tax professional to tax officials to GST portal to Banks to accounting authorities. The diagram given below depicts the whole GST eco-system.
Q 11. What is GSP (GST Suvidha Provider)? Ans. GST System will provide a GST portal for taxpayers to access the GST System and do all the GST compliance activities. But there will be wide variety of tax payers (SME, Large Enterprise, Micro Enterprise etc.) which may require different kind of facilities like converting their purchase/sales register data in GST compliant format, Integration of their Accounting Packages/ERP with GST System etc., various kind of dashboards to view Matched/Mismatched ITC claims, Tax liability, Filing status etc. As invoice level filing is required, so large organizations may require an automated way to interact with GST system as it may be practically impossible for them to upload large number of invoices through a web portal. So an eco- system is required, which can help such taxpayers in GST compliance.
As Tax payer convenience will be the key to success of GST regime, this eco-system will also provide Tax payer options of using third party applications, which can provide different kind of interfaces on desktop/mobile for them to be GST compliant. All above reasons require an eco-system of third party service providers, who have access to GST System and capability to develop such applications. These service providers have been given a generic name, GST Suvidha Providers or GSP. Q 12. What will be the role of GST Suvidha Providers (GSP)? Ans. GSP will be developing applications having features like return filing, reconciliation of purchase register data with auto populated data for acceptance/rejection/Modification, dashboards for taxpayers for quick monitoring of GST compliance activities. they may also provide role based access to divide various GST related activities like uploading invoice, filing returns etc., among different set of users inside a company (medium or large companies will need it), Applications for Tax Professional to manage their client’s GST compliance activities, Integration of existing accounting packages/ERP with GST System, etc. Q 13. What are the benefits to taxpayers in using the GSPs? Ans. At the outset it is clarified that all required functions under GST can be performed by a taxpayer at the GST portal. GSP is an additional channel being made available for performing some of the functions and use of their services is optional. Some of the specific solution(s) which
could be offered by the GSPs to meet specific requirements of Taxpayers for GST compliance are given below: 1. Conversion of their current invoice format generated by their existing accounting software, which could be in csv, pdf, excel, word format, into GST compliant format. 2. Reconciliation of auto populated data from GST portal with their purchase register data, where purchase register data can be on excel, csv or in any proprietary database and uploaded data from GST format could be in json/csv. 3. Organization having various branches will need a way to upload branch wise invoices, as GST System will only provide one user-id/password for GST system access. An application having role based access and different view for different branches will be needed. 4. A company registered in multiple States may require unified view of all branches in one screen, 5. GST professionals will need some specific applications to manage and undertake GST compliance activities for their client Tax payers from one dashboard, etc. Above are just a few illustrations. There will be many more requirements of different sets of Tax payers. These requirements of taxpayers can be met by GSPs. Q 14. What are the functions which a taxpayer will perform at the GST Common Portal being developed and maintained by GSTN for the taxpayers? Ans. GST Common Portal is envisaged as one-stop-
shop for all requirements under GST for the taxpayers. Illustrative list of functions that can be performed by taxpayers through GST Portal managed by GSTN are:  Application for registration as well as amendment in registration, cancellation of registration and profile management;  Payment of taxes, including penalties, fines, interest, etc. (in terms of creation of Challan as payment will take place at bank’s portal or inside a bank premises);  Change of status of a taxpayer from normal to Compounding and vice-versa;  Uploading of Invoice data & filing of various statutory returns/Annual statements;  Track status of return/tax ledger/cash ledger etc. using unique Application Reference Number (ARN) generated on GST Portal.  File application for refund etc.  Status review of return/tax ledger/cash ledger Q 15.

Yes, a taxpayer may choose a different GST Practitioner by simply unselecting the previous one and then choosing a new GST Practitioner on the GST portal. Q 22. Will existing taxpayers under Central Excise or Service Tax or State VAT have to apply for fresh registration under GST? Ans. No, the existing taxpayers under taxes which are to be subsumed under GST and whose PAN have been validated from CBDT database will not be required to apply afresh. They will be issued provisional GSTIN by GST portal, which will be valid for six months. Such taxpayers will be required to provide relevant data as per GST enrollment form online on GST Portal. On completion of data filing the status of taxpayer will change to Migrated. On appointed day the status of taxpayer will change to Active and he will be able to comply with requirements of GST regime for payment of taxes, filing of returns etc., on GST Portal.
GSTN has issued Provisional IDs and passwords to all such taxpayers and the same has been shared with tax authorities for conveying the same to the taxpayers.
